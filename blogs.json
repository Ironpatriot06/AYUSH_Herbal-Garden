Of all the herbs used within Ayurveda, tulsi (\nOcimum sanctum\nLinn) is preeminent, and scientific research is now confirming its beneficial effects. There is mounting evidence that tulsi can address physical, chemical, metabolic and psychological stress through a unique combination of pharmacological actions. Tulsi has been found to protect organs and tissues against chemical stress from industrial pollutants and heavy metals, and physical stress from prolonged physical exertion, ischemia, physical restraint and exposure to cold and excessive noise. Tulsi has also been shown to counter metabolic stress through normalization of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipid levels, and psychological stress through positive effects on memory and cognitive function and through its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties. Tulsi's broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which includes activity against a range of human and animal pathogens, suggests it can be used as a hand sanitizer, mouthwash and water purifier as well as in animal rearing, wound healing, the preservation of food stuffs and herbal raw materials and traveler's health. Cultivation of tulsi plants has both spiritual and practical significance that connects the grower to the creative powers of nature, and organic cultivation offers solutions for food security, rural poverty, hunger, environmental degradation and climate change. The use of tulsi in daily rituals is a testament to Ayurvedic wisdom and provides an example of ancient knowledge offering solutions to modern problems.\nKeywords:\nAdaptogen, Ayurveda, holy basil, lifestyle,\nOcimum sanctum\n, stress, tulsi\nINTRODUCTION\nDiseases of modern life\nDespite the many wonders of science and industry, modern life is fraught with stress. Mobile devices and the web have vastly increased the pace of life so that many people feel that they are now drowning in an ever-expanding ocean of data, while industrial agriculture has burdened us with increasing exposure to unhealthy processed and packaged food and a plethora of pesticides, food packaging materials and other toxic industrial chemicals. Urban dwellers are also faced with increasing wealth inequality, social isolation, excessive noise, air, water and soil pollution and disconnection from nature. Thus, while industrialization has led to longer lifespans and vast increases in human populations, it is now recognized that the greatest causes of death and disease on the planet are preventable lifestyle-related chronic diseases.[\nWe are in the midst of a global pandemic of obesity, diabetes, cancer, dementia, depression and other chronic diseases caused by modern lifestyles and their associated lack of physical activity, high intake of sugar, fat, salt, alcohol and tobacco and exposure to a toxic cocktail of industrial chemicals. The solutions to this current health crisis are therefore more likely to be found in the homes and behaviors of individuals than in medical clinics, hospital or pharmacies.\nAyurveda and lifestyle medicine\nAs a science of life and the world's oldest medical system, Ayurveda has a holistic approach to health and disease that focuses on preserving and promoting good health and preventing disease through healthy lifestyle practices. These practices include consumption of fresh, minimally processed foods, the use of Rasayanas (formulas) that eradicate ageing and disease, sophisticated detoxification practices and regular consumption of adaptogenic herbs that enhance the body's capacity to maintain balance in the midst of a variety of stressors.\nAyurveda's use of medicinal and culinary herbs draws upon India's incredible biodiversity with a variety that is unsurpassed by any medical system; yet, of all the herbs used, none has a status comparable to tulsi or holy basil (\nOcimum sanctum\nTulsi: A potent adaptogen\nTulsi is an aromatic shrub in the basil family Lamiaceae (tribe ocimeae) that is thought to have originated in north central India and now grows native throughout the eastern world tropics.[\n] Within Ayurveda, tulsi is known as “The Incomparable One,” “Mother Medicine of Nature” and “The Queen of Herbs,” and is revered as an “elixir of life” that is without equal for both its medicinal and spiritual properties.[\n] Within India, tulsi has been adopted into spiritual rituals and lifestyle practices that provide a vast array of health benefits that are just beginning to be confirmed by modern science. This emerging science on tulsi, which reinforces ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, suggests that tulsi is a tonic for the body, mind and spirit that offers solutions to many modern day health problems.\nTulsi is perhaps one of the best examples of Ayurveda's holistic lifestyle approach to health. Tulsi tastes hot and bitter and is said to penetrate the deep tissues, dry tissue secretions and normalize kapha and vata. Daily consumption of tulsi is said to prevent disease, promote general health, wellbeing and longevity and assist in dealing with the stresses of daily life. Tulsi is also credited with giving luster to the complexion, sweetness to the voice and fostering beauty, intelligence, stamina and a calm emotional disposition.[\n] In addition to these health-promoting properties, tulsi is recommended as a treatment for a range of conditions including anxiety, cough, asthma, diarrhea, fever, dysentery, arthritis, eye diseases, otalgia, indigestion, hiccups, vomiting, gastric, cardiac and genitourinary disorders, back pain, skin diseases, ringworm, insect, snake and scorpion bites and malaria.[\nConsidered as a potent adaptogen, tulsi has a unique combination of pharmacological actions that promote wellbeing and resilience. While the concept of an “adaptogen,” or herb that helps with the adaptation to stress and the promotion of homeostasis, is not widely used in Western medicine, Western science has revealed that tulsi does indeed possess many pharmacological actions that fulfill this purpose.\nThe medicinal properties of tulsi have been studied in hundreds of scientific studies including\nin vitro\n, animal and human experiments. These studies reveal that tulsi has a unique combination of actions that include: Antimicrobial (including antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antimalarial, anthelmintic), mosquito repellent, anti-diarrheal, anti-oxidant, anti-cataract, anti-inflammatory, chemopreventive, radioprotective, hepato-protective, neuro-protective, cardio-protective, anti-diabetic, anti-hypercholesterolemia, anti-hypertensive, anti-carcinogenic, analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-allergic, immunomodulatory, central nervous system depressant, memory enhancement, anti-asthmatic, anti-tussive, diaphoretic, anti-thyroid, anti-fertility, anti-ulcer, anti-emetic, anti-spasmodic, anti-arthritic, adaptogenic, anti-stress, anti-cataract, anti-leukodermal and anti-coagulant activities.[\n] These pharmacological actions help the body and mind cope with a wide range of chemical, physical, infectious and emotional stresses and restore physiological and psychological function.\nProtection and detoxification\nMany of the physiological benefits of tulsi can be attributed to its ability to assist with the body's internal housekeeping and protection of the body from toxin-induced damage. These functions are often attributed to tulsi's high content of phenolic compounds and anti-oxidant properties, with Krishna tulsi (black/purple variety) having a higher phenolic content and anti-oxidant capacity than white Vana (wild) tulsi.[\nLaboratory studies have shown that tulsi protects against toxic chemical-induced injury by increasing the body's levels of anti-oxidant molecules such as glutathione and enhancing the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, which protect cellular organelles and membranes by mopping up damaging free radicals caused by lack of oxygen[\n] and other toxic agents.[\nTulsi also helps to prevent cancers caused by toxic compounds by reducing DNA damage[\n] and inducing apoptosis in precancerous and cancerous cells, thereby reducing the growth of experimental tumors and enhancing survival.[\n] Furthermore, tulsi not only protects against the damage caused by toxic compounds, but also enables the body to more effectively transform and eliminate them by enhancing the activity of liver detoxification enzymes such as the cytochrome P450 enzymes, which deactivates toxic chemicals and enables them to be safely excreted.[\nWhile these actions are vitally important for protecting against natural toxins produced within the body or by animals or plants, they are perhaps even more important in the modern age to protect against the vast range of pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, radiation and other industrial toxicants created from human activity.\nToxicant stress: Chemicals, heavy metals and radiation\nThe ability of tulsi to protect against the damaging effects of various toxicants has been documented in numerous experimental studies. These studies attest to the ability of tulsi to prevent liver, kidney and brain injury by protecting against the genetic, immune and cellular damage caused by pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals. Thus, tulsi has been shown to protect against the toxic effects of industrial chemicals such as butylparaben,[\n] carbon tetrachloride,[\n] copper sulfate[\n] and ethanol,[\n] and common pesticides such as rogor,[\n] chlorpyrifos,[\n] endosulfan[\n] and lindane.[\n] Tulsi has also been shown to protect against the toxic effects of many pharmaceuticals drugs including acetaminophen,[\n] meloxicam,[\n] paracetamol,[\n] haloperidol[\n] and anti-tubercular drugs.[\nIn addition to protecting against toxic chemicals, tulsi has also been shown to protect against the toxic effects of heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium, chromium and mercury[\n] and the toxic effects of radiation.[\n] Tulsi exerts its radio-protective effects by scavenging free radicals and reducing the oxidative cellular and chromosomal damage induced by radiation,[\n] thereby reducing organ damage and enhancing postradiation survival in experimental animals.[\nPhysical stress\nThe actions that protect against the toxic effects of chemicals and radiation also help to address the toxic effects of many physical stressors. Prolonged physical exertion, physical restraint, exposure to cold and excessive noise disturb homeostasis by inducing physiological and metabolic stress. When the capacity to adapt to these stressors is exceeded, maladaptation occurs resulting in damage to biochemical pathways, organ function and health. Through enhancing various cellular and physiological adaptive functions, adaptogenic herbs such as tulsi are able to protect against this damage.\nStudies using forced-swimming, restraint and cold-exposure stress in laboratory animals have shown that tulsi enhances aerobic metabolism, improves swimming time, reduces oxidative tissue damage and normalizes many physiological and biochemical parameters caused by physical stressors. Similarly, experimental studies have shown that tulsi helps reduce the effects of acute and chronic noise-induced stress in experimental animals, with enhancement of neurotransmitter and oxidative stress levels in discrete brain regions along with improved immune, ECG and corticosteroid responses.[\nMetabolic stress\nMetabolic stress due to poor diet, low physical activity and psychological stress is a prominent feature of modern lifestyles and “metabolic syndrome” is estimated to affect as much as one-third of modern populations. Metabolic syndrome, also known as “prediabetes” or “Syndrome X,” includes the “deadly quartet” of centripetal obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and poor glucose regulation and is associated with chronic inflammation and a greater risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke. While the exact causes of metabolic syndrome are still being debated, there is evidence to suggest that tulsi can assist in dealing with many features of metabolic syndrome and their consequences.\nNumerous test tube and animal experiments as well as human clinical trials have shown that tulsi has anti-diabetic activity. Studies using diabetic laboratory animals have shown that tulsi can reduce blood glucose, correct abnormal lipid profiles[\n] and protect the liver and kidneys from the metabolic damage caused by high glucose levels.[\n] Tulsi has also been shown to improve lipid profiles,[\n] prevent weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance,[\n] and protect the organs and blood vessels from atherosclerosis[\n] in laboratory animals fed high-fat diets. Similarly, in human clinical trials, tulsi has shown to decrease glucose levels, improve blood pressure and lipid profiles[\n] and reduce many diabetic symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes.[\nThe beneficial metabolic effects of tulsi are multiple and include protecting the liver, kidneys[\n] and pancreatic islet cells from free radical damage;[\n] enhancing liver bile acid synthesis[\n] and reducing liver lipid synthesis;[\n] enhancing insulin secretion[\n] and action;[\n] lowering cortisol levels;[\n] and reducing inflammation. The anti-inflammatory action of tulsi, which has been observed in both acute and chronic inflammatory models in animals,[\n] is attributed to tulsi's eugenol and linoleic acid content and the inhibition of both the cyclooxygenase and the lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism.[\n] This enables tulsi to exert anti-inflammatory effects comparable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone,[\n] ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin[\n] and indomethacin.[\nInfection protection\nModern research has revealed that tulsi has anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal activity[\n] that includes activity against many pathogens responsible for human infections. Tulsi has also been shown to boost defenses against infective threats by enhancing immune responses in nonstressed and stressed animals[\n] and healthy humans.[\n] While no human trials have been published, there is experimental evidence that tulsi may help in the treatment of various human bacterial infections including urinary tract infections,[\n] skin and wound infections,[\n] typhoid fever,[\n] cholera,[\n] tuberculosis,[\n] gonorrhea,[\n] acne,[\n] herpes simplex,[\n] leishmaniasis,[\n] various pneumonias[\n] and fungal infections,[\n] as well as mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria and filariasis.[\nTulsi has also been shown to be active against many animal pathogens, and this has led to tulsi being used in animal rearing to reduce infections in cows,[\n] poultry,[\n] goats,[\n] fish[\n] and silkworms.[\n] Tulsi's activity against water-borne and food-borne pathogens further suggests that it can be used in the preservation of food stuffs[\n100\n101\n102\n] and herbal raw materials[\n103\n] as well as for water purification[\n] and as a hand sanitizer.[\n104\nTulsi's broad-spectrum activity, which includes activity against\nStreptococcus mutans\n, the organism responsible for tooth decay, further suggests that it can be used as a herbal mouth wash for treating bad breath, gum disease and mouth ulcers.[\n105\n106\n] This has been confirmed in clinical trials that have demonstrated that rinsing with tulsi is as effective as 0.2% Chlorhexidine and Listerine in reducing the levels of\nStreptococcus mutans\n107\n] and that a herbal mouthwash that includes tulsi is preferred for its taste and convenience.[\n108\nTulsi's unique combination of antibacterial antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities also makes it useful in wound healing.[\n109\n110\n] This is supported by experimental evidence that has shown that tulsi can increase wound-breaking strength and accelerate wound healing in laboratory animals.[\n110\n111\n] Tulsi has also been shown to have anti-ulcer and ulcer-healing activity that has been observed in many different animal models including aspirin-, indomethacin-, alcohol-, histamine-, reserpine-, serotonin-, acetic acid-, meloxicam-, cold restraint-, pyloric ligation- and stress-induced ulceration models.[\n112\n113\n114\n] This anti-ulcer activity is attributed to multiple actions including the reduction of offensive factors such as acid-pepsin secretion and lipid peroxidation and the enhancement of gastric defensive factors such as mucin secretion, cellular mucus and longevity of mucosal cells.[\n114\n115\nMental stress\nIn addition to physical, toxic and infective stress, modern living is associated with heightened levels of psychological stress caused by the many demands and fast pace of modern life. This stress compounds the toxic effects of chemical pollutants and the constant fear of pervasive toxic chemicals can itself lead to even further stress and anxiety that may be just as toxic as the chemicals causing it. While the reality of daily chemical exposure cannot be denied, regular consumption of tulsi not only helps protect and detoxify the body's cells and organs, it can also help reduce toxic stress by relaxing and calming the mind and offering many psychological benefits including anti-depressant activity and positive effects on memory and cognitive function.\nThe psychotherapeutic properties of tulsi have been explored in various animal experiments that reveal that tulsi has anti-anxiety and anti-depressant properties,[\n116\n117\n118\n] with effects comparable to diazepam and antidepressants drugs.[\n119\n120\n] Animal studies further reveal that tulsi enhances memory and cognitive function[\n121\n122\n] and protects against aging-induced memory deficits.[\n123\n] Similarly, in human studies, tulsi has been observed to reduce stress, anxiety and depression,[\n124\n] with a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study reporting that tulsi significantly improves general stress scores, sexual and sleep problems and symptoms such as forgetfulness and exhaustion.[\n125\nWhile modern scientific studies suggest that tulsi is effective in treating a range of stressful conditions, within Ayurveda, tulsi is more commonly recommended as a preventive measure to enhance the ability to adapt to both psychological and physical stress and therefore prevent the development of stress-related diseases. To this end, many Ayurvedic practitioners recommend the regular consumption of tulsi tea as an essential lifestyle practice.\nLiquid yoga\nRegular consumption of tulsi tea may be compared with the regular practice of yoga, which can be considered “adaptogenic” through nurturing and nourishing the body -- mind -- spirit while fostering a sense of relaxation and wellbeing. In contrast, regular consumption of caffeinated beverages such a black and green tea (\nCamellia sinensis L.\n) and coffee (\nCoffea arabica L.\n) may be compared with more aerobic exercise, which confers health benefits through stimulation and activation.\nLike yoga, tulsi has a calming effect that leads to clarity of thought, along with a more relaxed and calm disposition. The cognitive and memory-enhancing properties of tulsi therefore differ from those of caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee and tea, which heightens arousal and may cause physical and mental agitation. Furthermore, tulsi does not produce the same physical dependence as caffeine and can be safely consumed on a regular basis without the fear of withdrawal effects.\nThe drinking of tea and coffee has become an integral part of modern life and has been ritualized in many cultures to guide social interactions, set social agendas and invoke spiritual awareness. For example, sophisticated Asian tea ceremonies involve a whole set of rituals, tools and gestures that serve to transcend normal consciousness, while in the west the ritual of “afternoon tea” or “high tea” emphasizes the surroundings, equipment, manners and social circle. In less-formal situations, many people ritualize their morning cup of coffee and use the “meet-up for coffee” to arrange their social agendas, while the “tea break” is often built into the modern-day work routine. Yet, while tea and coffee have infiltrated their way into modern living, they have not yet attained the status that tulsi has within traditional Indian life.\nDivine tulsi\nIn Hinduism, tulsi is worshipped as a goddess and every part of the tulsi plant is revered and considered sacred, including the leaves, stem, flower, root, seeds and oil. Even the surrounding soil, which has recently been found to harbor beneficial endophytic fungi,[\n126\n] is considered an aspect of the divine. As such, Hindi households are considered incomplete without a tulsi plant, typically in an ornate earthen pot situated in a courtyard where tulsi serves both practical and ceremonial purposes. For example, tulsi's distinct clove-like aroma arising from its high eugenol content serves to link the householder to the divine while also repelling mosquitoes, flies and other harmful insects. Tulsi is further integrated into daily life through evening and morning rituals and other spiritual and purification practices that can involve ingesting its leaves or consuming tulsi tea.\nIn addition to sanctifying the home, tulsi is used ceremonially in Hinduism and some Greek Orthodox Churches to create “holy water.” Tulsi wood or seeds are also used to make tulsi malas, which are strings of beads used to help the mind focus during meditation, chanting and devotional practices and therefore ceremonially connect mind, body and spirit. Tulsi has also been used in cities to combat air pollution and hundreds of thousands of tulsi plants have been planted around the Taj Mahal in Agra to help protect the iconic marble building from environmental pollution damage.[\n127\nNature nurture\nThe cultivation and reverence for the tulsi plant in the home not only serves specific religious purposes it also directly connects the devotee with the creative power of nature. Connection with nature is profoundly healing and life-affirming; yet, the potential health, emotional, social and cognitive benefits of connection with nature are only just being realized in the west where disconnection from nature and “nature deficit” are common. A review of the scientific literature on the health benefits of connection to nature suggest that “access to nature plays a vital role in human health, wellbeing and development that has not been fully recognized,”[\n128\n] and there is now a global movement to reconnect people with nature that has arisen out of concerns over nature deficit, sedentary lifestyles, obesity, mental health issues, excessive use of electronic media, environmental degradation, wildlife conservation, sustainability and climate change.[\n129\nThe placing of a living tulsi plant at the center of the household, therefore, has applicability beyond the realms of Hinduism and may play a useful role in addressing modern day issues through embodying the healing power of the natural world and serving as a constant connection to living nature.\nQuality assurance and identification\nLike any medicinal plant, optimal cultivation, harvesting, preservation and storage methods are required to preserve tulsi's medicinal value. For example, it is suggested that tulsi should be grown employing organic methods in rural areas free from environmental pollution.[\n] This is supported by the finding of toxic elements at almost twice the concentration in tulsi leaves grown in polluted compared with unpolluted areas.[\n130\nIt is also important to ensure the correct herb is used and that manufacturers adopt stringent quality assurance standards and processes. Concerns about product quality in European “tulsi” products have been raised by reports of a high frequency of substitution with surrogate herbs such as\nOcimum basilicum L.\n131\n] This may be addressed using high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and microscopic assays to ensure batch-to-batch quality and the safety and botanical integrity of standardised extracts of standardized extracts.[\n131\n132\nTulsi as a vehicle of consciousness\nPerhaps one of the greatest of tulsi's benefits in the modern world comes from its global distribution based on its cultivation using ethical, fair trade, organic and ecological farming practices. There is a growing realization that in order to tackle issues of food security, rural poverty, hunger, environmental degradation and climate change a shift in agriculture is needed from a “green revolution” to an “ecological intensification revolution. This has been highlighted in a recent United Nations document titled “Wake Up Before It's Too Late,” which calls for the global community to endorse and advocate for local solutions to toxicity, food insecurity and poverty, such as the use of organic and small-scale farming over the use of genetically modified organisms and monocultures.[\n133\n] While ecological farming methods are not specific to tulsi, they have been effectively applied to tulsi cultivation by Organic India Pvt. Ltd. This company, which was established as a “vehicle of consciousness,” works with thousands of organic tulsi farmers in India to produce a business ecology whereby rural Indian farmers gain their dignity and a healthy and sustainable livelihood while serving to nurture the land they live on and produce a range of teas that enable consumers around the world to access the benefits of tulsi.\nCONCLUSION\nModern day scientific research into tulsi demonstrates the many psychological and physiological benefits from consuming tulsi and provides a testament to the wisdom inherent in Hinduism and Ayurveda, which celebrates tulsi as a plant that can be worshipped, ingested, made into tea and used for medicinal and spiritual purposes within daily life. In providing a focus for ethical, sustainable and ecological farming practices that provides a livelihood for thousands of farmers, the cultivation of tulsi goes beyond providing benefits for individuals and households and begins to address broader social, economic and environmental issues.\nFootnotes\nSource of Support:\nNil\nConflict of Interest:\nThe author receives remuneration as a consultant and advisor to Organic India Pvt.

It originated in South-East Asia and then used in many countries as a spice and condiment to add flavor to food.[\n] Besides this, the rhizome of ginger has also been used in traditional herbal medicine. The health-promoting perspective of ginger is attributed to its rich phytochemistry.[\n] Jolad\net al\n. grouped fresh ginger into two wide range categories, i.e. volatiles and non-volatiles. Volatiles include sesquiterpene and monoterpenoid hydrocarbons providing the distinct aroma and taste of ginger. On the contrary, non-volatile pungent compounds include gingerols, shogaols, paradols, and zingerone.[\nGinger has staring potential for treating a number of ailments including degenerative disorders (arthritis and rheumatism), digestive health (indigestion, constipation and ulcer), cardiovascular disorders (atherosclerosis and hypertension), vomiting, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. It also has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties for controlling the process of aging. Furthermore, it has antimicrobial potential as well which can help in treating infectious diseases.[\n] Generation of free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) during metabolism beyond the antioxidant capacity of a biological system results in oxidative stress,[\n] which plays an essential role in heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and in the aging process.[\n] The bioactive molecules of ginger like gingerols have shown antioxidant activity in various modules.[\nInflammatory disorders such as gastritis, esophagitis, and hepatitis, which are caused not only by infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites but also by physical and chemical agents like heat, acid, cigarette smoke, and foreign bodies, are recognized as risk factors for human cancer. Ginger consumption before exercise might reduce naturally occurring quadriceps muscle pain during moderate-intensity cycling exercise. This effect may be due to anti-inflammatory effect of ginger and further investigation need to prove it in human.[\nThis study aimed to review the current evidence on ginger effects as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a comprehensive search in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, in order to identify relevant studies. The electronic search was conducted in July 2012, and developed in collaboration with an experienced librarian. Time restriction were applied to year of publication from 2000-2012 and we used literatures only from English language and studied both human and animal models. All titles and abstracts were examined that met our search terms and full publications were reviewed, when necessary. Medline search with the terms: [Ginger] AND [anti-oxidative] and [Ginger] AND [anti-inflammatory], then we had 211 articles. Review articles were only included in this review if they offered new insights or opinions. We could achieve only to 59 articles from these articles and summarized 12 full text studies in the table.\nDISCUSSION\nAnti-oxidative stress effects\nThe rich phytochemistry of ginger includes components that scavenge free radicals produced in biological systems. For the purpose of energy production, some free radicals which generated during the process of oxidation are essential.[\n] Increased production of free radicals results in oxidative stress that can lead to DNA damage.[\n] In such circumstances of imbalance, extra antioxidant supplementation through dietary modules is essential for organism vitality.[\n] The anti-oxidative properties of ginger and its components have been explored in various\nin vitro\nand\nin vivo\ntests. Strengthening the body's defenses by improving the antioxidant status will undoubtedly protect human against many chronic diseases.[\n] 6-Shogaol has exhibited the most potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in ginger, which can be attributed to the presence of alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone moiety.[\n] Animal modeling showed that ginger significantly lowered induced lipid peroxidation and raised the levels of antioxidant enzymes, together with serum glutathione.[\n] Furthermore, feeding ginger to rats at 1% w/w during administration of malathion (20 ppm) for 4 weeks significantly attenuated malathion-induced lipid peroxidation.[\n] Concomitant dietary feeding of ginger (1%w/w) significantly attenuated lindane-induced lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), and the GSH-dependent enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase.[\nIn vitro\n, zingerone scavenged O\nand OH and suppressed lipid peroxidation, so it can possibly value in treatment of Parkinson's disease.[\nEthanol significantly decreased the superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione content in the hepatic tissue. This effect was improved by a treatment with 1% dietary ginger 1 month in rats which suggest that ginger may have protective role against the ethanol induced hepatotoxicity.[\n] Ginger and Arabic Gum showed renoprotective effects in renal failure. These protective effects may be attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating serum C-reactive protein levels and antioxidant effects by reducing lipid peroxidation marker, malondialdehyde levels, and increasing renal superoxide dismutase activity. They could be beneficial adjuvant therapy in patients with acute and chronic renal failure to prevent disease progression and delay the need for renal replacement therapy.[\nIn one study, ethanol extract of\nZ. officinale\nalone and in combination with vitamin E partially ameliorated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. This protection is mediated by renal antioxidant defense system.[\nIn the other study, the protective effect of the ginger extract was examined on CCl (4) and acetaminophen-induced liver damage and indicated that\nZ. officinale\ncould be useful in preventing acute liver injury.[\nThe overall evaluation of one study concludes that both spices ginger and cumin have good antioxidant potential, particularly fresh ginger. Methanol extracts of all the samples were found to have better antioxidant action than the\n-hexane extracts. There was also a good correlation between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of the non-volatile extracts.[\nRat studies showed that ginger has an equal antioxidant effect to that of ascorbic acid.[\nGhasemzadeh\net al\n. validated the medicinal potential of the leaves and young rhizome of\nZ. officinale\n(Halia Bara) and the positive relationship between total phenolics content and antioxidant activities in\nZ. officinale\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn ancient cultures, medical practitioners focused on herbs for promoting the immune systems of body. In many countries ginger and its products raise the immune system.[\nGingerol, shogaol, and other structurally-related substances in ginger inhibit prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis through suppression of 5-lipoxygenase or prostaglandin synthetase. Additionally, they can also inhibit synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-8.[\n] In another investigation, Pan\net al\n. showed that in macrophages,[\n] shogaol can down-regulate inflammatory iNOS and COX-2 gene expression.[\n] Jung\net al\n. indicated that rhizome hexane fraction extract of\nZ. officinale\ninhibited the excessive production of NO, PGE (2), TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta.[\n] Because of potent compounds in ginger rhizome for inhibiting allergic reactions, it may be useful for the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases.[\nHabib\net al\n. showed that ginger extract can reduce the elevated expression of NFκB and TNF-α in rats with liver cancer.[\n] The activation of NF-κB is linked to a variety of inflammatory diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, diabetes, allergy, asthma, arthritis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, psoriasis, septic shock, and AIDS.[\nLantz\net al\n. showed that gingerols can inhibit LPS-induced COX-2 expression while shogaol containing extracts has no effect on COX-2 expression. These data demonstrate that important compounds in ginger are capable of inhibiting PGE (2) production.[\nStudies evaluating the effectiveness of ginger in patients with osteoarthritis have controversial results. One study showed ginger extract to have a statistically significant effect on reducing symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee.[\n] In another study, the effect of ginger in osteoarthritis was significant only in the first period of treatment.[\n] In gout as a rheumatic disease of joints, [6]-shogaol has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and can be used as a curative agent.[\nBlack\net al\n. showed that treatment of patients with has hypo-algesic effects. They used 2 g of ginger supplementation for 11 days of on 36 participants to cure muscle pain. They proved that daily consumption of raw and heat-treated ginger resulted in moderate-to-large reductions in muscle pain.[\nHowever, cohort studies and controlled trails in sort of\nin vivo\nand\nin vitro\nneed to be to warrant the pharmacological applications of ginger.\nAnti-cancer effects\nThe mechanism of ginger for acting as chemopreventive spice remains a matter of conflict among researchers. Ingredients like [6]-gingerol,[6]-shogaol, [6]-paradol, and zerumbone in ginger exhibits anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic activities.[\n] Ginger and its bioactive molecules are effective in controlling the extent of colorectal, gastric, ovarian, liver, skin, breast, and prostate cancers.[\nColorectal cancer is more prevalent in vegetarians and ginger could be effective in reducing the extent of this disease. Manju and Nalini studied the efficacy of ginger against 1, 2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer. They observed that ginger supplementation can activate various enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione reductase and suppress colon carcinogenesis.[\n] Kim\net al\n. administered Zerumbone orally in mouse models and observed inhibition in multiplicity of colonic adenocarcinomas through suppression of colonic inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism of that includes inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and suppression of NF-κB and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression.[\nIn gastric cancer, the tumor necrosis factor-related inducing apoptosis ligand (TRIALS) plays a major role by promoting apoptosis. Cascades of caspase proteins activate by ginger and its functional components.[\n] Ishiguro\net al\n. explained a model for [6]-gingerol and[6]-shogaol action against gastric cancer cells. They observed that [6]-gingerol inhibits TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation by impairing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, suppresses cIAP1 expression, and increases TRAIL-induced caspase-3/7 activation.[\nYagihashi\net al\n. reported that [6]-gingerol can inhibit both proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction are the main causes of [6]-gingerol in these cancerous cells.[\n] Habib\net al\n. suggested that ginger extract can reduce the elevated expression of NF-κB and TNF-alpha in rats with liver cancer.[\nInhibition of angiogenesis in the mouse skin is the mechanism of ginger for treating of skin cancer.[\n[6]-Gingerol exhibited considerable cytotoxicity by growth inhibition of human epidermoid carcinoma cells mediated via reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced apoptosis.[\nThe effectiveness of ginger and its biomolecules has been demonstrated for controlling of ovarian cancer. Ginger inhibited NF-κB activation and diminished the secretion of VEGF and IL-8 helping to treat ovarian cancer.[\nZhang\net al\n. showed that zerumbone induced apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cells through p53 signal pathway, formation of apoptotic bodies, condensed nuclei, and the increased activity of caspase-3. So, zerumbone is a new therapeutic candidate for controlling of pancreatic cancer.[\n] Lee\net al\n. indicated that ginger can cure breast cancer via inhibiting cell adhesion invasion motility.[\n[6]-gingerol can affect prostate cancer models by modulation of proteins involved in apoptosis pathway.[\nAnti-diabetic effects\nSome research studies have proved the effectiveness of ginger against diabetes and its complications. Weidner and Sigwart conducted an experimental study and indicated that ginger extract with a high content of gingerols and shogaols did not induce significant changes in blood glucose, blood coagulation, blood pressure, and heart rate in rat models.[\n] However, ginger significantly lowered blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides, and raised HDL in hyperglycemic rats, in models that are diabetic, deficient in the apolipoprotein E gene or those that have been fed a high lipid diet.[\n] Bhandari\net al\n. showed that ethanolic extract of\nZingiber officinale\nfed orally for 20 days produced a significant antihyperglycaemic effect (\n< 0.01) in diabetic rats.[\n] Additionally, Nammi\net al\n. indicated that the ethanolic extract of ginger reduced body weights and levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phospholipids in high-fat diets.[\n] Heimes\net al\n. supported from this hypoglycemic potential, too.[\n] Insulinoptropic properties of ginger and glucose-lowering potential were explained by Islam and Choi.[\nWe summarized 12 studies from these articles in\nTable 1\nTable 1.\nTwelve selected studies with full text article\nOpen in a new tab\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe health-promoting perspectives of ginger are well known. It can treat a wide range of diseases via immunonutrition and anti-inflammatory responses. As a result of anti-inflammatory effect of ginger, it can reduce muscle pain after intense physical activity. Likewise, the anticancer potential of ginger is well documented and its functional ingredients like gingerols, shogaol, and paradols are the valuable ingredients which can prevent various cancers, angiogenesis and metastasis, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of cell-cycle progression. Besides these, it improves cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and gastrointestinal health.\nThis review concludes to favor ginger but some ambiguities necessitate further research before claiming its efficacy.\nFootnotes\nSource of Support:\nNil\nConflict of Interest:\nNone declared\nREFERENCES\nPark EJ, Pizzuto JM.

A new study shows that ambiguous mistakes in bimanual movements are corrected by the non-dominant hand, and responsibility for the error is assumed to fall to the effector with a recent history of poor performance.\nMain Text\nIn recent years, there have been a number of important theoretical developments which have revised the way we think about the control of human movement. Imagine a task such as playing a game of tennis. The challenges are daunting — the modern game is extraordinarily fast, and each action must be made at the limits of human reaction times, so that tennis strokes are planned and executed well before the ball arrives at the racquet. For a powerful player like Andy Roddick, the ball is served so fast — 155 mph — that it reaches the opponent's baseline in about 350 milliseconds. Estimating the ball's trajectory accurately enough to reach and return it requires the combination of incomplete sensory information from the visual system with prior knowledge of the ball's likely distribution of positions — Roddick tends to get the ball inside the tramlines more often than not. Kording and Wolpert\n[1]\nshowed in a laboratory version of this task that we use a Bayesian approach in which we optimally integrate sensory information about the current event with prior knowledge of the distribution of past events.\nConsider next the challenge for Roddick's opponent in returning the serve. He plans the swing of the racquet to reach the approaching ball, but again must integrate his motor plan with sensory feedback about its execution. The evolving act must be refined and modified as the latest sensory information is processed, specifying both where the ball is bouncing and how his race along the baseline is progressing. Todorov and Jordan\n[2]\ndeveloped the theory of optimal feedback control, in which sensory feedback and prior knowledge are combined into a ‘state estimate’ of the current situation that is integrated with the goal of the action to dynamically specify the optimal motor responses required. The key concept is of ‘minimum intervention’. Control gains are adjusted according to the task, allowing irrelevant parameters to be uncontrolled (low gain) while task-critical parameters have high gain\n[3]\n. This was a significant advance over previous theories which could define an optimal plan in advance of an action\n[4–6]\n, but could not easily modify the plan to deal with intrinsic variation in its execution or with changes in the external environment.\nNow, take things a step further. Imagine when someone like me attempts to play tennis. I might be ambitious and try a two-handed backhand stroke. But it goes wrong (it always does!) and the racquet misses the ball (\nFigure 1\nA). Is it because my left arm was weak, or my right arm a bit slow? How should I untangle the ambiguity about the responsible effector muscles so that I can first correct the mistake, and second learn from the mistake to improve my performance? Because I am right-handed, my left arm is likely to be less accurate, so should I try to use my right arm to correct for the error, as it is better able to do so, or should I make my left arm correct the mistakes it was responsible for, and learn from them for next time?\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nAssigning responsibility for motor errors.\n(A) Bimanual actions have redundancy because either or both arms can contribute to the action. So an error — missing the ball — could have been caused by a mistake from either arm. It might also be due to external events, such as a gust of wind. The ellipses indicate unequal certainty about the state of each arm. For right handers, the right arm is more reliable, less uncertain (red ellipse). So the mistake is more likely caused by the more uncertain left arm (blue). (B) Experimental design. The forward movement of a single cursor (centre) towards a target (yellow) is controlled by both unseen arms, but is rotated clockwise about its origin. The two hands share the correction (C\nand C\n). On the subsequent trial, the two hands also adjust their initial direction to better control the rotated cursor. (Panel B adapted from\n[7]\nAs they report in this issue of\nCurrent Biology\n, White and Diedrichsen\n[7]\nhave developed a clever experimental design to address these questions. Participants hold two lightweight mechanical arms and see the average of the two handle positions as a cursor on a screen which they must move towards a visual target (\nFigure 1\nB). Because the cursor reflects the average of both hands, the task is inherently redundant — one hand or the other could do all the work, or both hands can share the effort\n[8]\n. Likewise, an error — introduced experimentally by rotation of the path of the cursor around its start position — is ambiguous and could have been caused by either the left hand or the right hand misreaching. What the authors\n[7]\nfirst found is that for a group of right handers, the left hand corrected for the rotated cursor position more than the right hand. They confirmed this result by testing left handers, who are typically less lateralized than right handers, and found a weak effect in the opposite direction. Combing both groups, there was a strong relationship between handedness and the asymmetry of the corrections. The more dominant was one hand, the less likely it was to correct the error.\nWhite and Diedrichsen\n[7]\nasked how the two hands adapted to these errors. Again, across the group there was a correlation between the asymmetry of error correction on one trial and the asymmetric shift in reaching direction on the next trial (\nFigure 2\n). The arm that corrected more learned more from the mistake. In an elegant twist, they then pre-exposed one hand or the other to a series of high errors, in a unimanual version of the task, before again testing the bimanual responses. Their results show that recent history of poor reaching performance is enough to bias the corrective responses and the learning towards the worse hand. We do force the bad arm to learn better, rather than rely on the good arm to do all the work.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nLearning to correct for motor errors.\nAcross a group of participants, asymmetry of corrections was correlated to the asymmetry of subsequent adaptation, with the non-dominant hand correcting and adapting more. Follow-up experiments demonstrated that this effect was dependent on the recent history of errors — the hand making more errors learns more. (Adapted from\n[7]\nFinally, White and Diedrichsen\n[7]\naddressed two alternative hypotheses to explain all these results. The motor system might bias responsibility for error to the arm for which it has less reliable information about performance. If predictions about the outcome of the dominant hand's action are better, because that hand is more reliable and more skilled, then ambiguous errors might be assigned to the less reliable, less predictable non-dominant hand (\nFigure 1\nA). And because prediction errors are an important training signal\n[9]\n, the non-dominant hand would adapt more readily. Alternatively, the motor system might set the control gain higher for the less accurate hand, so that errors which are more likely to arise for that hand are more effectively corrected.\nWhite and Diedrichsen\n[7]\nseparated these two hypotheses with an experimental analogue of a gust of wind catching the tennis ball: the visual target, not the cursor, was suddenly shifted at movement onset. Now neither arm was responsible for the error, so inequality in the certainty of the two-state estimates should not result in asymmetric corrections, whereas inequality in control gains should. It turns out that the asymmetry of the responses does appear to be due to differences in control gain. This is a bit counter-intuitive, as much recent theory of motor control has shifted towards a more dominant role for prediction and state estimation\n[10–12]\n. However, the change in control gains is selective. Pre-training with target jumps did not affect later responses to cursor rotations, and\nvice versa\nThis new paper\n[7]\nis neat, and may alter the way neuroscientists think about issues of generalization of skills from one hand to another\n[13]\n. It also opens some interesting new questions about neural representations in the motor system. We think the brain includes internal models that capture the response properties of the joints and muscles it controls\n[14]\n, and probably has different models for different contexts — such as the behaviour of my arm with and without a tennis racquet in my hand. But do these models also code for the reliability of their internal estimates? Is the control gain set by this measure of reliability, so that a bad model has high gain, and must be pulled into line through a series of error corrections? Wolpert and Kawato\n[15]\nsuggested that multiple internal models contribute to each motor command, combined according to their responsibility for control over the motor context. The model with high responsibility has more control. White and Diedrichsen's\n[7]\nresults suggest an uncomfortable alternative: the models that are responsible for error, not for control, get the lion's share of the corrective task and of the learning that follows.\nReferences\nKording K.P., Wolpert D.M.

The primary objective of this study was to describe ioCS. A second aim was to identify risk factors of ioCS. We retrospectively analysed patients operated for small-bowel neuroendocrine tumour in our institution between 2007 and 2015, and receiving our preventive local regimen of octreotide continuous administration. ioCS was defined as highly probable in case of rapid (<5 min) arterial blood pressure changes ≥40%, not explained by surgical/anaesthetic management and regressive ≥20% after octreotide bolus injection. Probable cases were ioCS which did not meet all criteria of highly-probable ioCS. Suspected ioCS were detected on the anaesthesia record by an injection of octreotide due to a manifestation which did not meet the criteria for highly-probable or probable ioCS. A total of 81 patients (liver metastases: 59, prior carcinoid syndrome: 49, carcinoid heart disease: 7) were included; 139 ioCS occurred in 45 patients: 45 highly probable, 67 probable and 27 suspected. ioCs was hypertensive (91%) and/or hypotensive (29%). There was no factor, including the use of vasopressors, significantly associated with the occurrence of an ioCS. All surgeries were completed and one patient died from cardiac failure 4 days after surgery. After preoperative octreotide continuous infusion, ioCS were mainly hypertensive. No ioCS risk factors, including vasopressor use, were identified. No intraoperative carcinoid crisis occurred, suggesting the clinical relevance of a standardized octreotide prophylaxis protocol.\nKeywords:\ncarcinoids, neuroendocrine tumour, somatostatin\nIntroduction\nSmall-bowel neuroendocrine tumours (SB-NETs) are rare secreting neoplasms. Hormones (serotonin, histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandins and chromogranin-A) released into the systemic circulation can lead to a carcinoid syndrome (CS), which occurs in 10–20% of SB-NET patients. CS is characterized by isolated or associated symptoms such as cutaneous flushing (90%), diarrhoea (80%), abdominal pain (35%), bronchospasm (15%) and/or cardiovascular changes (hypo or hypertension, tachycardia or cardiac insufficiency (30%)) (\n). This syndrome can progress to a carcinoid crisis, a life-threatening complication combining severe hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrhythmias and failure and refractory bronchoconstriction (\n). Up to 40% of patients develop a carcinoid heart disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality (\nExpert groups recommend primary SB-NETs open surgical removal with partial bowel resection and lymphadenectomy even in the metastatic stages (>50% of cases at diagnosis) to prevent local complications and decrease tumour mass (\n). They also recommend the use of somatostatin analogues due to their anti-proliferative effect on SB-NETs and their antisecretory effect against CS (\nThe perioperative period is at high risk of intraoperative carcinoid syndrome (ioCS) as many triggering factors are present (\n). Hormone release can be caused by stress, hypoxemia, hypothermia, hypo or hypertension, pain, induction of anaesthesia, tumour manipulation and pharmacological agents, including anaesthetic drugs. Furthermore, vasopressor use has been suspected to trigger ioCS by promoting SB-NET hormone release and to result in paradoxical effects (\nHowever, only few studies reporting on the clinical presentation of ioCS have been published (\n). Thus, the primary endpoint of this study was to describe ioCS. The second aim was to identify risk factors of ioCS in patients operated of SB-NETs, receiving a continuous infusion of intravenous somatostatin analogue started from the preoperative period.\nMaterials and methods\nAfter approval by the ethics committee of our institution (Comité de protection des Personnes SUD-EST IV, Lyon), we retrospectively analysed a series of consecutive patients who underwent resection of SB-NET in our institution between January 2007 and December 2015. This study was approved by the national data protection commission (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés, CNIL) on 6 November 2015 (n°15-111). Consents have been obtained from patients after full explanation of the purpose and nature of data used. All patients receiving our local regimen of preoperative continuous octreotide were included. Patients operated for other neuroendocrine tumour location, hepatic metastases only or not receiving our octreotide administration regimen were not included.\nPerioperative octreotide administration\nOctreotide was administered 12–48 h prior to surgery by intravenous continuous infusion at a dose of 40 µg/h or 80 µg/h if patient had prior CS, hepatic metastases or carcinoid heart disease. Octreotide was continued during the intraoperative and postoperative periods at the same doses. IoCS were treated by additional intraoperative octreotide boluses (0.5–2 µg/kg) and surgical break.\nioCS definition\nHighly probable ioCS was defined as rapid (onset period ≤5 min) hemodynamic changes (heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP)) ≥40%, not explained by surgical or anaesthetic management and regressive ≥20% within 5 min after the octreotide bolus injection; probable ioCS was defined as cases for which manifestations did not meet all criteria of highly probable ioCS (onset period of 5–10 min and/or hemodynamic changes of 20–40% and/or no octreotide bolus and/or no reversibility of ≥20% after octreotide injection and/or confounding factors related to anaesthetic management). Suspected ioCS was detected on the anaesthesia record by an injection of octreotide for a manifestation which did not meet the criteria of highly-probable or probable ioCS.\nMedian variations of BP and HR from basal state to maximum and then during regression for each type of ioCS were collected. Carcinoid crisis was defined as a life-threatening ioCS refractory to octreotide boluses. Carcinoid crisis includes cardiogenic shock, severe cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest or bronchospasm refractory to bronchodilators and compromising mechanical ventilation.\nAnaesthetic management\nAll patients had preoperative assessment, including a transthoracic echocardiography at least 48 h prior to surgery. The day before surgery, premedication with antihistamines or gabapentin was prescribed if anxiety was 6 or more on a 10-point verbal numeric scale. After standard monitoring installation, anaesthesia was induced intravenously with propofol or etomidate, remifentanil and cisatracrium. Anaesthesia was maintained with desflurane delivered by control mode mechanical ventilation (Primus, Drägerwerk AG & Co. KGaA, Lübeck, Germany) and with a continuous infusion of remifentanil. Adequate muscle relaxation was obtained by intravenous cisatracrium boluses according to train-of-four monitoring. Two 16 or 18-G peripheral venous catheters and a triple lumen central venous line were inserted. An arterial catheter was inserted at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist as were transoesophageal Doppler (WAKI\nTO, Atys medical, Soucieu-en-Jarrest, France) and Bispectral index (BIS) (BIS, Covidien, Ilc, Mansfield, USA). Warming blankets were always used (3M Bair Hugger therapy, 3M Health Care, St. Paul, USA). Hypotensive episodes were treated by octreotide boluses and, if necessary, by ephedrine (0.10–0.15 mg/kg) or phenylephrine (1–2 µg/kg) boluses and then by norepinephrine intravenous continuous infusion starting at dose at 0.05 µg/kg/h.\nData collection\nThe following clinical parameters were recorded: age, gender, physical status ASA score, cardiovascular history (hypertension, cardiac failure), prior CS (flushing, diarrhoea, bronchospasm), prior carcinoid heart disease, hepatic and extra-abdominal metastases, elevated urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and the prior use of long-acting somatostatin analogues. Anaesthesia management with use of premedication, anaesthetic agents, and vasoactive drugs, as well as the timing of occurrence of ioCS during the surgical procedure, hemodynamic changes during ioCS, the type of surgical procedure and number of SB-NETs on histologic examination were recorded, as was death following carcinoid crisis.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables with a Gaussian distribution were reported as mean with standard deviation (\ns.d.\n) and compared with the Student\n-test, whereas continuous variables with a non-Gaussian distribution were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared using the Mann–Whitney test. Univariate analyses of potential ioCS risk factors were performed. Categorical variables were compared using a\nor Fisher exact test. A\nvalue ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 81 patients (42 males) underwent SB-NET surgery during the study period and were included. The mean (\ns.d.\n) age was 59 (\n) years. The ASA score was 1–2 for 65 patients, and 35 had a previous cardiovascular history. Among those, 49 patients had prior CS (diarrhoea 39, flushing 42, bronchospasm 1); seven patients had carcinoid heart disease and two patients a tricuspid valve replacement one year before abdominal surgery. Fifty-nine patients had hepatic metastases and seven an extra-abdominal location of NET. Urinary 5-HIAA levels were elevated for 40 patients. Octreotide protocol was started 21 (\n) hours before surgery and was respected for 64 patients (11 patients had a lower dose).\nAll patients underwent bowel resection, 79 with ileocolic anastomosis and 78 with lymphadenectomy. The median (IQR) number of tumours removed was 1 (\n). Hepatic resection was performed in 12 patients. The mean (\ns.d.\n) operative time was 300 (92) min. All tumours were confirmed to be SB-NET. Characteristics of intraoperative anaesthetic management are shown in\nTable 1\n. Sixty-five patients had premedication, with antihistamines in most of cases.\nTable 1.\nIntraoperative anaesthetic management.\nHypnotics\nEtomidate\nPropofol\nOpioids\nRemifentanil\nKetamine (antihyperalgesic dose)\nNeuromuscular blocking agent\nCisatracurium\nSuccinylcholine\nPostoperative analgesia\nMorphine\nLidocaine IVSE\nHaemodynamic monitoring\nArterial catheter\nTransoesophageal Doppler\nBispectral index\nVasopressor use\nEphedrine\nPhenylephrine\nNoradrenaline\nVolume expansion (mean ±\ns.d.\n, mL/kg/h)\nCrystalloid\n6.6 ± 2.2\nColloid\n0.7 ± 0.9\nAlbumin\nBlood transfusion (mean ±\ns.d.\n2 (2)\nNumber of packed red blood cells\n2.5 ± 0.7\nUrinary output (mean ±\ns.d.\n, mL/kg/h)\n1.5 ± 1.1\nOpen in a new tab\nA total of 139 episodes of ioCS (highly probable, probable and suspected) occurred in 45 patients. The mean (\ns.d.\n) number of ioCS episodes per patient was 3 (\n) (\nFig. 1\n). Up to 11 ioCS occurred for two patients during surgery. IoCS was a hypertensive (91%, 41 patients, 107 episodes) and/or a hypotensive episode (29%, 13 patients, 32 episodes). Cutaneous flushing occurred in 3 patients. No episode of dysrhythmia or bronchospasm occurred. Time of occurrence of ioCS was tumour manipulation (\n= 37 patients, 82%), incision (\n= 8 patients, 18%) and anaesthetic induction (\n= 2 patients, 4%). No triggering factor of ioCS was identified for 11 (1/4) patients. Patients received a mean (\ns.d.\n) of 3 (\n) octreotide boluses during surgery. No side effects or cardiac conduction abnormality induced by octreotide injection occurred. BP and HR variation during ioCS were recorded (\nTable 2\n). BP changes during hypotensive episodes of ioCS were more pronounced on systolic arterial pressure than on mean and diastolic arterial pressure. There was no significant HR variation during ioCS.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExample of individual recording of multiple intraoperative carcinoid syndromes during small-bowel neuroendocrine tumour surgery.\nTable 2.\nHemodynamic changes during hypertensive and hypotensive episodes of intraoperative carcinoid syndrome.\nVariations median % (IQR)\nHypertensive episode\nHypotensive episode\nHighly probable (\n= 36)\nProbable (\n= 56)\nSuspected (\n= 15)\nHighly probable (\n= 9)\nProbable (\n= 11)\nSuspected (\n= 12)\nSAP before ≥ during\n53 (44–64)\n35 (27–48)\n18 (5–33)\n49 (46–55)\n28 (24–49)\n10 (6–15)\nSAP during ≥ after\n24 (21–30)\n22 (14–30)\n8 (2–19)\n63 (47–81)\n28 (21–33)\n7 (2–15)\nMAP before ≥ during\n51 (45–63)\n35 (24–51)\n14 (4–3)\n24 (23–30)\n15 (9–19)\n3 (2–6)\nMAP during ≥ after\n31 (22–40)\n23 (15–33)\n3 (−1 to 12)\n49 (34–88)\n24 (14–33)\n5 (1–15)\nDAP before ≥ during\n49 (39–59)\n35 (22–50)\n9 (−1 to 31)\n16 (13–18)\n9 (6–13)\n2 (1–4)\nDAP during ≥ after\n24 (13–34)\n18 (8–24)\n1 (−2 to 8)\n48 (37–71)\n25 (10–34)\n5 (−1 to 18)\nHR before ≥ during\n11 (3–20)\n10 (2–16)\n1 (−3 to 8)\n3 (0–10)\n0 (−3 to 1)\n−1 (−2 to 0)\nHR during ≥ after\n3 (0–12)\n2 (−1 to 6)\n0 (−2 to 7)\n−2 (−14 to 1)\n2 (−3 to 9)\n0 (1–4)\nOpen in a new tab\nAmong probable ioCS, missing criteria to classify them as highly probable ioCS were, for hypertensive and hypotensive episodes respectively, hemodynamic changes ≤40% (57% and 73%), onset period between 5 and 10 min (14 and 9%), no octreotide injection (48 and 0%), reversibility ≤20% after octreotide injection (4 and 0%) and confounding factors with anaesthetic management (16 and 18%).\nThere was no factor, including the use of vasopressors, significantly associated with the occurrence of ioCS (\nTable 3\n). The analysis was repeated with patients who experienced only highly probable ioCS with the same result.\nTable 3.\nCharacteristics of patients according to occurrence of intraoperative carcinoid syndrome (ioCS).\nNo ioCS,\nAt least one ioCS,\nNumber\nPreoperative carcinoid syndrome\n0.90\nDiarrhoea\n0.94\nCutaneous flush\n0.60\nCarcinoid heart disease\n0.12\nHepatic metastases\n0.17\nElevated preoperative output of 5-hydroxylindoleacetic acid (missing data = 17)\n0.14\nPremedication with antihistamines\n0.29\nIntraoperative vasopressors use\nEphedrine\n1.00\nPhenylephrine\n0.98\nNoradrenaline\n0.75\nHepatic resection\n0.92\nOpen in a new tab\nNo intraoperative carcinoid crisis occurred during the study period. All surgeries were completed. One patient died postoperatively, 4 days after surgery, developing a carcinoid crisis with a refractory cardiac failure and a cardiac arrest. He was a 74-year-old man who had a highly secreting tumour with a severe clinical presentation, an asymptomatic carcinoid heart disease, and hepatic metastases.\nDiscussion\nAfter preoperative continuous octreotide infusion, ioCS were mostly hypertensive and no ioCS risk factor was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first study that pre-defined ioCS in order to describe the occurrence and the risk factors of this complication.\nThere is no consensus for ioCS definition. Seymour\net al\n. underlined the heterogeneity in the definition of ioCS and carcinoid crisis (\n). Moreover, clinical manifestations of ioCS under general anaesthesia can be modified and identifying this complication can be difficult. In addition, Bijker\net al.\nunderlined the difficulty to define intraoperative hypotension regarding the variability of definitions through studies depending on the threshold values, BP type (systolic vs mean BP), measurement interval and method (noninvasive vs invasive) and minimal episode duration (\n). It results in wide incidence of intraoperative hypotension and different associations between intraoperative hypotension and adverse outcomes. This suggests that a dynamic approach of intraoperative BP variations could be of clinical relevance, more than dichotomic thresholds. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyse ioCS as a dynamic phenomenon using a definition taking into account onset time, variation of BP or HR, reversibility after octreotide injection and absence of confounding factors with surgical or anaesthetic management.\nThe overall incidence of ioCS was higher than the previously published series (24–38%) (\n). However, the analysis of each episode reveals that incidence of ioCS could be lower. Indeed, some suspected ioCS may have incorrectly been recorded as ioCS. Clinical manifestations of ioCS contrast with other studies which report hypotensive episodes to be much more frequent. Indeed, Massimino\net al.\nreported a hypotensive episode for 19% of patients, defined as PAS <80 mmHg during ten minutes (\n). Condron\net al.\npublished a series of 127 patients with 30% of ioCS (76% of hypotensive and 7% of hypertensive episodes) (\n). One explanation could be the regimen of octreotide administration. There remains variability in practices regarding the timing and dosage of preoperative octreotide. Recommendations regarding octreotide infusion vary according to administration regimen, preoperative dose and infusion rate during surgery (\n). Different affinity with somatostatin receptors and a dose-dependent effect on hormone release could explain the different types of clinical manifestations.\nFew patients needed several injections (up to three boluses) to control ioCS suggesting the efficiency of low dose of octreotide. No intraoperative carcinoid crisis occurred and all surgeries were completed. Although continuous octreotide infusion is insufficient to prevent all ioCS, our local protocol seems to be effective to prevent carcinoid crisis, the most feared complication.\nNo factor was statistically associated with occurrence of ioCS. In 1/4 of cases, no triggering factor was found suggesting that ioCS can occur at any time and that anaesthetists should be constantly ready to treat hemodynamic instability. The small sample size is likely to be a major limitation for the identification of predictive factors. However, another explanation could be related to the protocol used that includes a double dose of octreotide in case of preoperative CS, hepatic metastases, or carcinoid heart disease, which may have reduced the risk of ioCS in such patients to that of other patients. Some reports suggest that vasopressor use can trigger ioCS and recommend to avoid this medication (\n). This is controversial and many studies have reported safety with vasopressor use (\n). The results herein suggest that intraoperative use of vasopressor in CS patients is safe to treat hypotension without paradoxical effects. The results also suggest that systematic premedication with antihistamines to decrease anxiety and stress in order to avoid hormone release is useless.\nThe study has some limitations. First, it was a single-centre study, but this design allowed for homogeneous surgical procedure and anaesthetic management. These results are related to our local protocol of octreotide and they could be different with other octreotide administration protocols. Second, our definition of ioCS was developed by an experienced anaesthetist team, but it can be discussed. We did not include duration of each ioCS. The analysis of hypertensive episodes reveals an increase of BP ≥50% during highly probable ioCS. This threshold for diagnosis of ioCS could be decreased considering ioCS classified as probable because of a variation of BP lower than 40%. Thus, a better definition of ioCS is needed but requires validation in a prospective multicentric study. Third, the retrospective nature of this study did not allow for a deep assessment of postoperative complications. Thus, the impact of ioCS on outcomes, as Condron and Massimino\net al.\nreported was not feasible (\n). In addition, a lack of power due to the relatively small sample size did not facilitate the identification of ioCS risk factors.\nIn conclusion, when a preoperative continuous octreotide infusion is administered to patients, ioCS are mainly hypertensive. No ioCS risk factors, including vasopressor use, were identified. A standardized octreotide prophylaxis protocol seems to be clinically relevant to manage ioCS and to prevent occurrence of carcinoid crisis.\nDeclaration of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sector.\nAuthor contribution statement\nContributed to the design of the work, acquisition of data: M F, Y B, M-C L, J P, F M, P S, F C, D H S, A P, G P , T W, T R.

This study aimed to find and make record of plants that are used for medicinal therapy by three communities living in Cherangani Hills. So far no single study has documented medicinal plants as a whole in the area. Ethnobotanical data were obtained through interviewing informants using semi-structured questionnaires and extracting information from journals and books. Descriptive statistical analysis was applied to describe the data. Overall 296 plant species from 80 families and 191 genera were identified. Asteraceae family was the most dominant, representing 10.7% of the total plant species recorded. Roots (35.9%) represented the most commonly used parts of the plant. The commonly used method of preparation was decoction (54.9%). The reported diseases were classified into 14 diverse ailment groups out of the 81 health conditions on their underlying user reports. Rural communities in Cherangani Hills are rich sources of plants with medicinal properties. Therapeutic uses of the compiled plants provide basic information that can aid scientists to conduct additional research dedicated to conservation of species and pharmacological studies of species with the greatest significance.\nKeywords:\nCherangani Hills, ethnobotanical, medicinal plants, decoction, informants, ailment categories, conservation\n1. Introduction\nMedicinal plants have been a vital source of both curative and preventive medical therapy preparations for human beings, which also has been used for the extraction of important bioactive compounds [\n]. It is estimated that almost 80% of the world’s total population, regularly, depends on traditional medicine and products for its healthcare needs especially in third world countries. Many sick people in the developing regions combine the conventional medicine with traditional medicine [\n]. Traditional medicines are usually cheaper than modern medicines, and probably the only natural remedies available and accessible in the remote rural communities in developing countries [\n]. Rural dwellers prefer traditional medicines because of their close proximity to the traditional healers and the fact that the healers understand their culture and environment as well as their patients. In rural areas, access to western healthcare is a problem especially in the Sub-Saharan countries, because conventional healthcare is concentrated in towns [\n]. Plant medicine has continuously been practiced for a long period, especially in some African tribes with a long history [\n]. The Kenyan diversified flora with over 7000 plant species is one of the richest in East Africa [\n]. Consequently, the higher number of plant species have led to discovery of many medicinal plants in the region. In Kenya, more than 70% of the people use local home-made remedies as their first source of medicine, while more than 90% use plant related remedies at one time or another [\n]. Phytotherapy is another fundamental part of the native communities of Kenya who have vital indigenous knowledge acquired through generations. However, this practice is often less transferred owing to industrialization and adoption of western life style. Traditional knowledge in many Kenyan ethnic tribes remain untapped since the medicinal plants have not been fully documented as the information is passed orally from one generation to the other posing danger of its loss [\nIndiscriminate trade of plant resources, uncontrolled collecting methods, habitat change, overexploitation, and climate change pose great threats to availability of plant medicine in most third world countries, thus, creating a pressing need for better methods of conservation and viable use of priority plant resources [\n]. In Kenya, research on ethnobotany has been on going after independence and several publication of guides and books have been published [\n]. Recording and preserving the traditional knowledge on medicinal plants has become very important practice in recent times [\n]. Several ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological research studies have been published documenting Kenya’s medicinal plant knowledge and use: Marakwet county [\n], Northern Kenya [\n], Siaya county [\n], Tugen [\n], Machakos county [\n], Samburu county [\n], Sekanani Valley, Maasai Mara [\n], Kajiado county [\n], Embu and Mbeere county [\n], Makueni county [\n], Mount Elgon [\n], Nakuru county [\n], Nandi county [\n], Tharaka Nithi county [\n], Kakamega county [\n], Kitui county [\n], Elgeyo Marakwet county [\n], Kericho county [\n], Machakos county [\n], Narok county [\n], Trans-Mara county [\n], Kilifi county [\n]. However, in Kenya, many areas and ethnic societies are yet to be ethno botanically surveyed.\nThis study focused on three communities in Cherangani Hills and the medicinal plants used to treat different ailments. The documentation of the natural resources is key as it will assist in the conservation of residual and remaining forests [\n]. The databases obtained in this research forms a foundation for potential development of new medicines [\n]. Ethnobotanical investigations are vital in preserving traditional medicine through suitable documentation of plants, which also assist in its sustainability [\n]. Previous studies have been carried out in sections of Cherangani hills hence this research aimed to cover medicinal plants in the entire study region.\n2. Material and Methods\n2.1. Study Area\nThis study covered the human settlement areas around and adjacent to the Cherangani Hills forest ecosystem found in the western side of Kenya (\nFigure 1\n). Cherangani Hills reserve (35°26′ E, 1°16′ N), cuts across three counties, namely Trans Nzoia (1551 Ha), Elgeyo-Marakwet (74,249 Ha), and West Pokot (34,380 Ha), totaling 110,181 Ha, and is occupied by three ethnic groups comprising Luhya, Marakwet, and Pokot people respectively. The hills comprise 12 forest blocks where medicinal plant resources were collected and include Kipkunurr, Kapolet, Sogotio, Chemurkoi, Kaisungor, Cheboyit, Embobut, Kererr, Kiptaberr, Kapkanyar, Toropket, and Lelan [\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nCherangani hills forest Ecosystem. (\n) Map of Kenya (\n) the distribution of Cherangani hills.\n2.2. Selection of Respondents\nPurposive sampling was applied in the field investigation, where traditional therapists and elders helped to pin point medicinal plant practitioners and emphasis was laid on both women and men [\n]. Seventy-eight practitioners (38 women and 40 men) were sampled near each of the 12 forest block locations. Selected group of respondents were distinguished in the region because of their long tradition in providing services allied to traditional health remedies. Fifty-one practitioners were traditional healers and the remaining number were village elders who had acquired familiarity on medicinal healing skills of plants from their parents and close relatives.\n2.3. Ethnobotanical Data Collection and Plant Identification\nEthnobotanical information were gathered between September 2017 and January 2019 by interviewing, using methodological ways designed in ethnopharmacological in field data collection. The local chiefs were informed afore about the initiation of the survey and permission was allowed. Interviews, discussions, formal and informal conversations, as well as field visits were conducted [\n]. More information was sourced from literature studies including journal articles and books [\n]. Botanical names, local names, diseases treated, method of preparation, dosage, and modes of administration were recorded. An interview was carried in the local dialect and translated to English. Data on habit, habitat, and plant parts used were recorded. For each described plant species, a specimen was taken and preliminary identification was performed in the field. The specimens were pressed, dried, and the identification results were confirmed at the East African herbarium. A specimen voucher number was given and prepared for each collected herbarium specimen and deposited in the East African Herbarium (\nSupplementary material Table S1\n). Authentication of identified plant specimens was verified using the Flora of East African by comparisons with authenticated specimens at the East African Herbarium (EA), Nairobi, Kenya. The scientific names indicated in\nSupplementary material 1\n, in this research work are the recognized names according to “The plant List” database.\n2.4. Data Analysis\n2.4.1. Informant Consensus Factor\nInformant consensus factor (ICF) was computed using a mathematical expression: ICF = (N\n− N\n)/(N\n− 1), where N\nrefers to the summed up number of citations for each disease group and N\nis the number of plant species used in that category [\n]. The lowest ICF value is 0.00 and the highest is 1.00. Low ICF values indicates that informants do not agree on which plant medicine to use in a particular ailment, while high ICF values indicate that a limited number of plant species are known to be administered by a large number of informants to treat a specific disease. High ICF values can further be investigated and used to find species of important bioactive compounds [\n2.4.2. Fidelity Level (FL)\nFidelity level (FL) is the total number of informants who referenced the consumption of some medicinal plants to treat a specific disease in the region and is calculated by the following formula: FL = Np/N × 100, where Np represents total number of informants citing the use of the plant to be administered to a particular disease and N denotes the total number of informants who utilized the plants as a medicine group [\n]. Plant species with a higher percentage of FL shows the frequency and high usage in healing a specific disease by the informants in the community and vice versa when the percentage is low.\n2.4.3. Jaccard’s Coefficient of Similarity (JCS)\nJaccard’s coefficient of similarity (JCS) was computed to compare the medicinal plant composition and their similarity with other counties in Kenya. Similarity values were computed between other areas already studied by other researchers in different regions in comparison with the present study area. JCS, was calculated as: JCS = c/(a + b + c), a representing the total number of medicinal plant species obtained in area A, b is the total number of medicinal plant species discovered only in area B, and c is the total number of common plant species occurring in areas A and B [\n3. Results\n3.1. Demographic Profile of Respondents\nA total of 40 (51.2%) males and 38 females (48.7%) were interviewed. The results between male and female informants were almost equal.

Habit, Parts Used for Medicine and Methods of Preparation\nGrowth habit of shrubs have the highest percentage of 35.1% of the total medicinal plants in this study. Total of 27.5% of trees are represented by the total number plant species (\nFigure 3\na), followed by herbs (26.5%), climbers (10%), epiphytes, and parasites with 0.3% each. The plant parts used include roots (35.9%), leaves (34.9%), bark (15.0%), fruits (5.2%), branches (5.0%), whole plant (1.9%), flowers (1.1%), seeds (0.2%), and barks of roots (0.2%) (\nFigure 3\nb). People living in the study area use different methods to prepare different medicines for treatment of different ailments. Decoction (boiling) proved to be used more commonly as the mode of preparation (53.3%), followed by pounding/crushing (24.5%), and chewing (9.3%). Other preparation methods represented less than 5% (\nFigure 4\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\n) Medicinal plant habit, (\n) plant parts for herbal preparation around Cherangani Hills.\nFigure 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nPreparation methods for medicinal plants.\n3.5. Informant Consensus Factor (ICF)\nTo obtain the accurate ICF, the reported diseases were grouped into 14 different ailment groups out of the 81 health conditions based on their use reports (\nTable 3\n). The results of the reported ailments are as follows; digestive system disorders (25.2%), respiratory tract infections (18.3%), parasitic diseases (17.9%) (\nTable 3\n). Stomachache (8.9%), malaria (6.7%), aphrodisiac (6%), coughing (4.8%), and abdominal pains (3.4%) were the most common disease mentioned. Within the three major disease groups, digestive system disorders had 139 use-reports, followed by respiratory tract infections (101) and parasitic diseases and other infections (99) use-reports. The greatest ICF (0.79) was mostly for metabolic disorders, followed by gynecological issues (0.76). Respiratory tract infections, erectile dysfunctions, and impotence were less frequently and had the lowest IFC of 0.27 and 0.18 respectively.\nTable 3.\nInformant consensus factors for categorized ailments.\nAilment Categories\nSpecific Conditions\nNumber of Used Reports\n% of Total Species\nNo. of Taxa\nICF\nDigestive system disorders\nUlcers, diarrhea, stomachache, dysentery, constipation, low appetite, nausea, purgative, intestinal worms, gastrointestinal disorders, amoeba.\n139\n25.18\n108\n0.22\nRespiratory tract infections\nCold, cough, respiratory infections, asthma, bronchitis, flue, sore throat, tuberculosis\n101\n18.30\n0.27\nParasitic diseases and other infections\nMalaria, fever, measles, headache, yellow fever, ear, conjunctivitis, toothache, mouth blisters eye infections\n17.93\n0.62\nErectile dysfunctions and importance\nMale sexual vitality, aphrodisiac\n7.07\n0.18\nGynecological issues\nFertility enhancer, heavy menstrual flows, uterine cleansing, weakness during pregnancy, induction of labor, sterility in women, induce pregnancy, removing placenta, regulation of monthly periods, abortion, after birth pains, menstrual pains\n5.98\n0.76\nSkin infections\nWounds, burns, smallpox, ringworms, warts, skin rashes, leprosy, astringent, boils\n5.62\n0.75\nCirculatory system diseases\nHypertension, anemia, cuts, hemorrhoids, blood cleanser, hemorrhage, heart attack reduce bleeding, edema.\n3.99\n0.67\nBlood and Urinary system disorders\nUrinary infections, kidney inflammations.\n3.8\n0.70\nPoisonous and animal bites\nSnake, centipede and insect bites\n2.89\n0.53\nMuscular-skeletal problems inflammation\nBackache, joint pains, rheumatism, fractures, joints inflammation, swollen body parts.\n2.72\n0.50\nNeurological and nervous System disorders\nConvulsions, epilepsy, memory and neurological disorders, madness reduction.\n2.17\n0.50\nGenital apparatus diseases\nGenital organs infection, sterility, infertility, prostate infections, syphilis, and gonorrhea\n1.99\n0.71\nMetabolic disorders\nLiver diseases, hepatic.\n1.45\n0.79\nCancers\nBreast cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer\n0.91\n0.57\nOpen in a new tab\n3.6.

Jaccard’s Coefficient of Similarity\nThis study represents the first scientific documentation of ethnobotanical uses of 296 medicinal plant used by the three communities in Cherangani hills. The current report on the ethnomedicinal uses of plants was compared to those of previous studies done in other regions of Kenya (\nTable 5\n). It was found that Marakwet (18%), Sungurur (16%), and Keiyo (14%) had the highest Jaccard’s coefficient of similarity in the makeup of medicinal plant species whereas the degree of similarity was lower in areas like Nandi (0.05%) and Kitui (0.06%) (\nTable 5\nTable 5.\nA comparison of medicinal plants within the study area and those in other extents.\nStudy Area (County)\nYear of Study\nSpecies No. (x and y)\nCommon Species (z)\nJaccard’s Coefficient\n% Similarity\nReferences\nCherangani\n2019\n286\nThis review\nMachakos\n2018\n0.06\nKakamega\n2018\n250\n0.13\nKakamega\n2018\n0.12\nSungurur\n2017\n0.16\nMakueni\n2017\n0.06\nNandi\n2015\n0.09\nTharaka Nithi\n2015\n0.06\nMarakwet\n1978\n111\n0.18\nKakamega\n2014\n0.07\nKeiyo\n2014\n0.14\nMt.

Threats to Medicinal Plants\nInformants’ responses showed that many factors have contributed to the threats faced by plants of medicinal importance in the study area. (\nTable 6\n). Agricultural expansion (38.5%) was the main threat to important medicinal species, followed by overgrazing (20.5%), overharvesting (17.9%), firewood and Charcoal production (10.3%), environmental degradation (7.7%). Some respondents pointed out that other threats exist within the study area that are a result of deforestation and loss of habitat (5.1%).\nTable 6.\nThreats to medicinal plants in Cherangani Hills.\nThreats\nFrequency (N = 78)\nPercentage (%)\nAgricultural expansion\n38.5\nOvergrazing\n20.5\nOverharvesting\n17.9\nFirewood and Charcoal production\n10.3\nEnvironmental degradation\n7.7\nOthers\n5.1\nOpen in a new tab\n4. Discussion\nThe communities around Cherangani hills forest reserve use a large diversity of flora in the treatment of a myriad of diseases and the native people have a broad traditional knowledge on plants of medicinal importance. The higher percentage of people that rely on medicinal plants could be attributed to the high cost of western medicine and inaccessibility of government medical facilities [\n]. There was an insignificant difference between men and women in the knowledge of medicinal plants. Comparing with other study area in Kenya [\n], there was no gender preference in the passing of medicinal plants knowledge from the parents to their offspring across local communities around Cherangani Hills. Informants in the age group above 45 years appeared to know more medicinal plants perhaps as a result of having more experience interacting with medicinal plants in their ecosystem. Additionally, fewer medicinal plants were known to those who attended tertiary levels of education compared to illiterate informants. The insignificant use of the plants of medicinal importance by the literates in the community can be attributed to lack of general preparation procedures and scientific information on their efficiency as well as their toxicity levels. Additionally, the collection as well as storage methods were identified as essential considerations by the literate members in the community. This indicates that there exists a generational disjunction in the passage of traditional medicinal plant knowledge. This can be linked to the influence of formal education as it was observed that illiterate informants had an upper hand in medicinal plants knowledge as compared to their tertiary level counterparts. Exposure of younger people to modern education and lifestyle has led them to prefer western medical treatment over traditional medicine hence despising medicinal plant treatments compared to those unexposed and uneducated [\nOut of the 296 medicinal plants recorded, shrubs are commonly used because of their relatively higher resistance to drought, hence preferred as they are available for harvesting all year round [\n]. Roots are most preferred compared to other parts of the plant as they are traditionally considered to have a higher strength of medicine and are readily available in all the seasons of the year [\n]. Leaves are also highly utilized because they are obtained easily in large quantities in contrast to other plant parts. Moreover, a majority of traditional healers prefer to use leaves as they are considered to accumulate active ingredients by photosynthetic pigments such as alkaloids and tannins [\nA myriad of methods of preparation are used within the three communities of Cherangani Hills and Kenya as a whole. In the study area it was uncovered that decoction was the most widely used method of preparation mainly because of the ease of using water to prepare them. Such a large variety of preparation methods that have been studied has been highlighted in some parts of Kenya and in other countries [\n]. It has been established that more than one method is used in preparing many of the medicinal plants studied. However, the type of plant species, condition of ailment being treated, and plant parts used determined the method of preparation. Within the Marakwet, Luhya, and Pokot communities, the common way of administration of the prepared medicine was through drinking, which is in line with many other studies [\nGastrointestinal ailments were the most frequently treated using medicinal plant followed by sensory-neuron diseases. In similar fashion, disorders of the gastrointestinal system and parasitic infections were the commonly treated ailments and similar results have been reported in Kenya and Zegie peninsula [\n]. Stomachache and diseases related to digestive system could be attributed to poor sanitation as a result of high levels of poverty within the study region as in the case cited by other studies [\n]. High FL of a species in the scope of this study shows the extensive use of a particular plant species to treat certain diseases by the inhabitants because of its ease of accessibility and its effectiveness to treat the diseases. Such information may lead to the efficacy of these plants and their chemical and pharmacological components of the reported activity against various diseases. For example,\nCarissa spinarum\nL. with FL = 90.5 is good for treating malaria. The plant contains important bioactive constituents including glycosides, acids, saponins, tannins, terpenoids, and alkaloids which have medicinal value [\n]. Within the area studied,\nCarissa spinarum\nL. is mainly used in treating malaria, chest pains, epilepsy, diarrhea, coughs, breast cancer, arthritis, and gonorrhea.\nDifferent ecological climatic conditions have been characterized with different plant diversity, hence pointing to some of the probable reasons for similarities and differences of plants of medicinal value found in our study area and other extents. Data collected and analyzed from the region of study reveal remarkable differences in parts of the plant used, preparation mode of herbal medicine and their use as has been documented in other regions. However, 82% of medicinal applications were new and unique to the study at hand.\nThe use of medicinal plant species recorded in the same study area had 14%, 16%, and 18% JCS respectively and the neighboring areas like Kakamega [\n] showed remarkable similarity at, 12%, 12%, and 13% JCS respectively. There was close resemblance in terms of the usage of medicinal plants because of close proximity to the research area.\nThreatened medicinal plant species recorded in this study include\nWarburgia ugandensis\nSprague. (VU) and\nAnsellia africana\nLindl. (VU). The rest of the medicinal plants are either data deficient (DD), not evaluated (NE), or of least concern (LC), by IUCN. Many factors have been associated with the dangers faced by the medicinal plants in the study region. Informants’ insights show that the main threats to plants of medicinal value were forest encroachment for agricultural expansion, overharvesting, overgrazing, and environmental degradation (\nTable 6\n). Majority of the respondents indicated that agricultural activity (38.5%) was a significant danger to the existence of medicinal plants and their conservation because of an increase in human population. Some respondents pointed out that medicinal plants within the area of study had other threats as a result of deforestation and loss of habitat. A study by Mutwiwa [\n] also listed overgrazing, charcoal burning, and environmental degradation as some of the threats faced by the plants of medicinal value in Machakos County, Mwala sub-county, Kenya. From our assessment in the course the field investigations, it was further noted that none of the listed medicinal plants were cultivated by the communities.\n5. Conclusions\nPlanting fast-growing plant species for the production of charcoal would greatly help in lowering the harvesting of medicinal plants and enhance the conservation of vulnerable plant species. Proper grazing management of domestic animals should be enforced by the authorities in the forest reserves to reduce overgrazing especially in the areas of the forest that are more susceptible to overgrazing like the forest periphery. Proper harvesting regulations should be implemented and followed to reduce overharvesting and overexploitation of medicinal plants especially those species that are used more frequently to treat common ailments. This study provides a detailed report and an appreciation of medicinal knowledge among the three communities around the Cherangani Hills. The awareness of the importance of medicinal plants in human healthcare is important as scientific evaluation promises their future use in the development of new drugs for emerging diseases. The information on medicinal plants, dosages, and the ailments treated might be heavily eroded in the days to come because of the observed poor record keeping and the increasing use of western medication. This inventory therefore can be used as a source of information for the conservation agencies to enable proper management of plant biodiversity and its resources.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are in gratitude to the Kenya Forest Service and National Environment and Management Authority for enabling the access to permits that empowered us to take on botanical investigations in the Cherangani Hills Forest.

This technology eliminates the need for soil and reduces water usage by providing nutrients straight to the\nplant's roots. The Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and automation are all used in \"smart farming,\" which allows for constant monitoring of\nsoil conditions, nutrient levels, and plant vitality to facilitate fine-grained management and optimization. The technology-driven strategy\nimproves crop output, quickens growth rates, and keeps conditions ideal all year round regardless of weather or other environmental\ncircumstances. In addition, smart farming lessens the need for organic chemical inputs, promotes environmentally safe methods of pest\nmanagement, and minimizes the amount of waste produced. This ground-breaking strategy may significantly alter the agricultural sector\nby encouraging regionalized food production, enhancing food security, and adding to more resilient farming practices. This comprehensive\nreview delves into current trends in Hydroponics, highlighting recent advancements in smart farming systems, such as Domotics, Data\nAcquisition, Remote Cultivation, and automated AI systems. The review also underscores the various types and advantages of smart\nfarming hydroponic technology, emphasizing the requirements for achieving efficiency in this innovative domain. Additionally, it explores\nfuture goals and potential developments, paving the way for further advancements in hydroponic smart farming.\nKeywords:\nSmart Farming, Hydroponics, IoT, Sensors, Domotics, Remote Cultivation, Data Acquisition, Future smart farming\nBackground:\nHydroponics is the practice of growing plants in a nutrient-rich water solution instead of soil [\nThe term \"hydroponics\" originated from the Greek- \"hydro,\" which means water, and \"ponos,\" which means labour [\nPeat moss, charcoal, gravel, rock wool, perlite, coco peat, and coconut coir are only some of the inert media used in hydroponic\nsystems to support plant roots [\n]. The system may\nbe engineered to give the plants the optimal quantity of water, nutrients, and oxygen for optimal development. Hydroponic systems are\nused commercially and in private homes to cultivate a wide variety of plant life, including vegetables, fruits, herbs, and flowers.\nWhile the concept of soilless growing has been around for millennia, the modern hydroponic system was developed in the middle of the\n20th century as a solution to boost food production in locations with limited resources and space [\nIt is believed that the Hanging Gardens were created utilizing the first known application of hydroponic cultivation\n]. To prove that plants might grow successfully without soil, a Flemish botanist named Jan\nvan Helmont undertook experiments in the 17th century. Later, in 1800, French scientists De Saussure and Boussingault proved that\nplants require carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen for proper growth. Subsequently, in 1860, German scientists Sachs and Knop\nadded to De Saussure and Boussingault's list by cultivating plants in aqueous solutions including salts of phosphorus, sulphur,\npotassium, calcium, and magnesium [\n]. William\nFrederick Gericke is often cited as an early proponent of growing plants without soil. Because he believed it would be more efficient\nand successful, Gericke focused on developing methods for cultivating plants without soil. Using lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers as\nexamples, he conducted a slew of experiments demonstrating that plants could grow and flourish in nutrient-rich water so long as\ntheir fundamental nutritional demands were met. The concept of soilless agriculture owes a great deal to Gericke's research, which\nalso laid the framework for modern Hydroponics [\n]. Hydroponics is now widely utilized in\ncommercial and domestic settings to cultivate various products, from leafy greens to tuber crops to tomatoes and herbs. Its promise\nto boost food production and sustainability, decrease water consumption, and raise crop yields has recently increased in popularity\nImportance and relevance of Hydroponics in urban farming:\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization's report in 2001, it is projected that the global population will reach 9.7\nbillion by 2050. This will require a 60% rise in the production of food worldwide. The current state of under nourishment has found to\naffect around 11% of the global population, and there has been an upward trend in this figure in recent times. As though, food\nsecurity has emerged as a prominent concern in the current era, representing a critical challenge for the agricultural sector\n[Tilman, 2002] [\nFurthermore, the number of malnourished individuals stands at approximately 690 million. According to research, livestock farming\nutilizes around 80% of the global agricultural land, necessitating significantly more land than plant-based food farming. According to\nresearch, approximately 30% of the global food supply is wasted annually [\n]. According to\nrecent data, most of the world's population resides in urban areas, surpassing the number of individuals living in rural regions.\nSpecifically, in 2018, cities accommodated 55% of the global population [\n]. According to\nanother study, the percentage of the global population residing in urban areas was 30% in 1950 [\nHowever, projections indicate that by 2050, this figure is expected to increase to 68% [\nEven though, urban populations have been rapidly increasing, nevertheless, agriculture has been able to meet their growing demands by\nproducing food that requires higher energy, land, water, and generates increased greenhouse gas emissions. The primary concern lies in\nwhether agriculture can sustainably keep up with the changing demands of urban populations while also promoting agricultural\nprosperity and reducing poverty in both rural and urban regions [\n]. When taking the\nperspective of urbanisation and limiting the poverty, focusing on smart farming is a far more effective way to reduce poverty than\ninvesting in other areas, as agriculture has given its pivotal role in a country's infrastructure and its potential impact on\nconflicts and wars which were driven by historical land-related food disputes [\n]. Such that\nthe expansion of urban areas creates competition for resources such as soil, water, and labour with agriculture. This could be\nattributed to the influx of people and the reclassification of land use [\n]. The competition\nfor limited resources has led to a situation where advanced agriculture is required to increase its productivity to addressing the\nissue on diminishing the burden of poverty chain and simultaneously combating demand of land and climate change concerns\nHydroponics, however, is a crucial feature of contemporary farming, especially in the context of \"smart farming.\" It offers some\nbenefits and addresses serious problems with traditional agricultural methods. Hydroponics has several advantages over conventional\nagricultural techniques like using soil and greenhouses. Hydroponics allows for economical water consumption, typically using as much\nas 90% less water than conventional farming methods [\n]. Hydroponics, with its carefully\ncalibrated nutrient solutions, may produce far greater quantities of greens than conventional soil gardening [\nHydroponics also allows for greater crop output per unit area because of its vertical farming methodology, which makes the most\nefficient use of available space [\n]. It was recorded that there was a significant decrease\nin photosynthetic photon flux density and shoot fresh weight in the Vertical Farming Systems [VFS] as the distance from the apex to\nthe foundation increased. However, despite this reduction, the VFS generated a greater amount of crop per unit of cultivation space\ncompared to the horizontal hydroponic system [\n]. The study's findings indicate that VFS may\nbe a viable substitute for horizontal hydroponic development mechanisms.\nAdditionally, the study suggests that integrating artificial lighting into the VFS may lead to even higher yields. Pests and\nillnesses are less likely to be a problem with hydroponic systems, lowering the demand for chemical pesticides [\nFinally, Hydroponics allows for continuous production throughout the year independent of external weather conditions, guaranteeing a\nsteady supply of fresh vegetables [\n]. Hydroponics often provides a better Return On\nInvestment [ROI] than conventional farming methods because of its greater productivity and quicker harvest times [\nResearch findings indicate that hydroponic lettuce production has the potential to generate significantly higher yields per acre in\ncomparison to soil-based cultivation, with reported increases of up to 20 times. The enhanced productivity observed in hydroponic\nfarming systems has been found to result in improved financial returns and a faster return on investment. Compared to conventional\nagricultural methods, hydroponic systems may increase lettuce yields by as much as 20 times per acre [\nBrault et al., conducted a study on the year-round production of lettuce using the nutrient film technique in a greenhouse with\nartificial lighting to investigate the feasibility of using this technique to produce lettuce throughout the year, which involved the\nuse of a greenhouse with artificial lighting to provide the necessary light and the nutrient film technique to provide the necessary\nnutrients to the plants. The study's findings indicated that hydroponic lettuce farming in a controlled environment enables\nuninterrupted and reliable year-round crop yield, thus surmounting any seasonal constraints [\nBy implementing a controlled environment and precise nutrient management, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of achieving\nuninterrupted tomato production regardless of external weather conditions, facilitating year-round market supply [\nThe researchers achieved continuous pepper production throughout the year by maintaining optimal environmental conditions, including\ntemperature, light, and nutrient supply [\n]. In another study, the research findings indicate\nthat implementing hydroponic cultivation methods and regulated environmental factors enabled uniform strawberry yield, irrespective of\nseasonal constraints [\n]. These benefits demonstrate the practicality and longevity of\ngrowing hydroponically-cultivated leafy greens.\nAdvantages of hydroponic farming System:\nResource Efficiency: The optimization of resources like water, nutrients, and space is a key benefit of Hydroponics. Hydroponic\nfarming techniques have been found to reduce water usage by up to 90% compared to conventional soil-based farming. Additionally, this\nmethod allows for the recycling and reutilization of nutrient solutions, promoting sustainability and minimizing waste. The\nimplementation of vertical farming techniques has been found to optimize space utilization, resulting in the ability to achieve\nhigh-density crop production [\nYear-Round Crop Production:\nHydroponics allows for cultivation throughout the year without being affected by seasonal or climatic constraints. Growers can\nutilize controlled environments to establish the ideal conditions for plant growth, encompassing temperature, humidity, light\nintensity, and nutrient concentrations. Maintaining a consistent and dependable food supply, decreasing reliance on imported goods,\nand improving food security are all important factors to consider [\nIncreased Crop Yields:\nResearch has shown that hydroponic systems accurately regulate growth conditions, leading to increased plant growth rates and\ngreater crop yields than traditional farming techniques. Research has shown that customizing nutrient delivery and optimizing the root\nzone environment can improve plant health and productivity. [\nEnvironmental Sustainability:\nThe utilization of Hydroponics has been found to reduce the adverse effects of agriculture. The elimination of soil dependency\nresults in a reduction of soil erosion, loss of nutrients, and spoilage. Integrating Hydroponics with sustainable practices, such as\norganic pest control, water recycling, and renewable energy sources, can contribute to a more environmentally friendly approach to\nfarming [\nNutritional Quality and Flavour:\nThe precise control of nutrient levels and growing conditions in hydroponic cultivation can improve crop quality and flavour.\nHydroponic cultivation can be particularly noteworthy for speciality crops, herbs, and medicinal plants due to the potential to\noptimize specific compounds and active ingredients. [\nPest and Disease Control:\nHydroponics provides a soil-less environment, reducing the risk of soil-borne pests and diseases. Integrated Pest Management [IPM]\ntechniques can be implemented more effectively in Hydroponics, utilizing biological controls and minimizing the need for chemical\npesticides. This leads to healthier plants and safer produce [\n]. Urban Agriculture and Local\nFood Production: Research suggests that Hydroponics is a suitable method for urban agriculture as it allows food production in\nconfined spaces such as rooftops, vertical farms, or indoor facilities. Promoting local food production has been found to positively\nreduce transportation distances and improve access to fresh, regionally produced crops. Strengthening local involvement and knowledge\nabout sustainable food systems is also observed [\n]. Scientific Research and Innovation:\nHydroponics is a platform for scientific research and innovation in agriculture. Researchers can explore new techniques, develop\nimproved cultivars, and test novel approaches for sustainable food production. Integrating smart technologies, automation, and data\nanalytics further advances the field and facilitates continuous improvements in hydroponic farming practices. Hydroponics is a\ngame-changer in modern agriculture, offering increased efficiency, sustainability, and productivity. Its ability to overcome the\nlimitations of traditional farming methods makes it a valuable tool for meeting the challenges of food security, environmental\nconservation, and the growing demand for nutritious and high-quality produce.\nTypes of Hydroponic Systems:\nHydroponic systems can be classified mainly into two based on the substrate used soilless-solution culture and granular-substrate\nculture Hydroponics [\n]. Types of hydroponic systems that are in use today and their\nspecification with the list of plants that grow best in them are tabulated (\nTable 1\nTable 1. Types of Hydroponic systems and specific plants.\nS.No\nHydroponic System\nCharacteristics\nSpecific Plants\nReference\nNutrient Film Technique (NFT)\nThe roots of plants in NFT systems are constantly bathed in a thin coating of nutrient-rich water, from which they may draw the nutrients they need. The excess liquid is collected and subjected to a recycling process\nLeafy Greens, Herbs, Strawberries\nBeans\nRaddish, Cucumber\nDeep Water Culture (DWC):\nThis involves the suspension of plant roots in a nutrient solution that is continuously oxygenated through an air pump. The roots of plants that remain submerged in water can absorb more nutrients and oxygen due to their prolonged exposure to the aquatic environment. The Dutch bucket system is a well-liked deep-water hydroponic system that offers a productive and regulated environment for plant growth. Individual buckets or containers filled with an inert medium, such as perlite or coconut coir, support the plants while enabling their roots to reach a nutrient-rich solution. Due to its scalability, simplicity of use, and adaptability for various plants, this system is commonly employed in commercial Hydroponics.\nLettuce, Herbs, Leafy Greens, And Plants With Larger Root Systems Like Tomatoes, Cucumbers, And Peppers.\nDrip System:\nThe utilization of drip systems entails the direct delivery of nutrient solutions to the root zone of plants through an arrangement of tubes and drippers. The method involves dripping the solution onto the chosen growing medium, such as perlite or coco coir, and subsequently allowing it to drain back into the container for potential reuse.\nVegetables, Fruits, Herbs, And Flowering Plants.\nEbb and Flow (Flood and Drain)\nThis involves the cyclic submersion of plants in a nutrient solution, followed by subsequent drainage back into a reservoir. The regular repetition of this cycle facilitates the provision of nutrients and oxygen to the roots.\nTomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, Strawberries. Lettuce.\nSpinach.\nRadishes.\nBeans.\nAeroponic\nThis involves the suspension of plant roots in the air, with intermittent nutrient solution application as a fine mist or spray to the roots. The observed phenomenon enables a higher level of oxygenation and nutrient uptake.\nLeafy Greens, Herbs, Strawberries\nCapsicum,\nCauliflower,\nChilli\nWick System\nPassive hydroponic setups known as wick systems are characterized by their simplicity. In this experimental setup, the plants are situated within an inert growing medium, and a wick composed of a cotton rope is employed to facilitate the upward movement of the nutrient solution from a reservoir to the root zone.\nSmall Plants, Herbs, And Low-Nutrient-Demanding Plants\nKrakty method\nAmong the other types of hydroponic methods, this system is much easier and cheaper; it does not require electronic devices and does not need electric current to operate. The entire crop needs an initial administration of water and nutrients, making the system an effective plant production method. The static, suspended-pot method is highly efficient for minimizing water wastage.\nLeafy Greens, Herbs\n] [\nOpen in a new tab\nOverview on Recent developments in Hydroponics:\nInnovative technologies, including smart home technology (domotics), IoT automated growing techniques, and AI-based systems, have\nincreasingly entered the mainstream recently and, to add to that, have relevant applications in indoor hydroponic productions\n]. The amount and accessibility of knowledge\non the web means that increasing numbers of individuals are starting to explore these growth strategies for various motives, and both\nhydroponic and indoor cultures are growing in popularity with farmers [\nDomotics for indoor cultivation- control tools:\nIt is important to consider the concept carefully while establishing a facility for indoor production and hydroponic planting.\nSpecifically, the spot, dimension, targeted plant species, and tools required for the particular task must be considered. A hydroponic\nfarming system and an indoor conservatory must operate with various specialized gadgets. To provide the optimal climate for the growth\nof plants, we will consequently need lights with specialized ranges for horticulture, aspirators for the movement of air, humidifiers,\nfans, heat producers, etc. Thermo-hygrometers for determining both humidity and temperature, heating systems that regulate aspirators\nor cooling systems, and hygrostats to regulate humidifiers or dehumidifiers are a few control devices employed nowadays for improved\nand controlled production. However, advanced Software-based controls with programs that can handle information collected by sensors\nand regulate the operation of lights, aspirators, humidifiers, etc., through in-built applications to maintain stable every\nenvironmental condition are inadequate now.\nData Acquisition for Cultivation:\nThe effectiveness or lack thereof of the yield might be influenced by a wide range of internal and external elements, including\nconventional methods of manual monitoring and measurements, which tend to be ineffective and insufficient in various ways. In this\ntime when information is easily accessible, sustaining the authenticity of the agricultural system depends on reliable information\ngathering and dissemination. These numbers and facts are statistics compiled to provide backed-up, empirical results that might\ngreatly enhance yield quality [\n]. As a result, farming will become increasingly data-driven\nand data-enabled. Even though machines do a sizable portion of processing work, individuals will still be engaged. Innovative\nagriculture combines various automated technologies with big data availability to optimize and increase the production of crops to\neliminate the need for human intervention and labour [\n]. The technical developments brought\nabout by globalization now include innovative agriculture. More automation and machine learning in farming are anticipated to result\nfrom new technologies like the Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing that could implement data and communication processes,\nincreasing production [\n]. Large firms and companies are anticipating that massive Data in\nPeta and Zeta bytes has an enormous opportunity to generate revenue in various manners [\nThe term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes an interconnected system of objects, tools, automobiles, constructions, and other\ntechnological sensing devices, like software enabling the exchanging of data. This primarily includes Radio Frequency Identification\n(RFID), and sensors. The fusion of the natural environment with computing devices and online resources offers valuable data and\nfunctionality for improved production [\n]. In a study in 2017 to validate the effect of\nInternet of the Things on Smart Hydroponic Farming Ecosystem (HFE)\" sensors and relays were exploited efficiently. The authors\nincorporated the monitoring and regulating characteristics into their prototype design to validate variables for 27 days: temperature\nof air and water, moisture, pH level, electrical conductivity (EC), water height, flow rate and nutrient concentration. The Arduino\n2560-based information recorder was developed to gather data from five sensors on six distinct variables and store it on an SD card to\nshow system efficiency instantaneously [\n]. Kyaw et al. designed a prototype utilizing\nsensors to collect data and actuators to regulate settings to validate aquaponics (growing fish with Hydroponics). They employed\nsmartphone apps for quick systems management and cloud-based storage for their regression data assessment of fish and plant growth\nRemote cultivation:\nTypically, a remote monitoring system comprises two overarching classifications of components, namely the remote telemetry units\n(RTUs) and the master stations. In broad terms, the Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) acquire data, while the master units analyze and\nexecute commands based on the acquired information. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) operate by being configured to collect exact\ncategories of data. Every device is designed to oversee particular elements of the agricultural land and transmit a notification to\nthe central system in case of any deviation from the predetermined parameters [\nIntegration of IoT in Vertical Farming:\nVertical farming is a popular trend in Hydroponics that involves stacking multiple layers of plants in a vertical arrangement. This\nfarming method saves space, reduces water usage, and increases yields per square foot of growing area. In response to increased demand\nfor agricultural productivity, vertical farming is a new technology that aims to boost crop yield per unit of land. VF is a\ntechnically challenging and pricey crop production method that uses protected horticulture systems like glasshouses and controlled\nenvironment facilities along with numerous layers of growth surfaces and/or inclined production surfaces. As a result, VF requires a\nscientific approach that considers various elements, including lighting, crop nutrition, growing systems, energy efficiency,\nconstruction, and site selection [\n]. The Internet of Things (IoT)is used in vertical farming\nto monitor environmental conditions and collect data on individual plants. IoT systems use this information to formulate accurate\nrecommendations for the amounts of light, water, and nutrients that should be provided to each plant. An IoT device prototype for\nsmart vertical farming with LED lights, sensors, a wooden board, and a battery is presented in the International Journal for Research\nin Applied Science and Engineering Technology. The prototype is equipped with sensors such as a light-detection resistor (LDR), soil\nmoisture sensor (SMS), and LM35 temperature sensor (TMS), which together gather data on plant development and then analyze and show\nthat data in a web application for optimal efficiency [\n]. Recently, there have been reports\nof a smartphone app developed in Android Studio that allows users to regulate and track plant development in hydroponic vertical\nfarming systems. Using Internet of Things technology, sensors are used to monitor environmental and dietary factors including\ntemperature, humidity, TDS, pH, and water level. The Thing-Speak cloud platform was then used to send the data. The Tashi Home\nPindfresh system and Arduino and Raspberry Pi have been utilized as control centres [\nAeroponics Technology:\nAeroponics is an indoor horticulture technique that suspends plant roots in a nutrient-rich mist, allowing maximum oxygenation and\nnutrient uptake. This highly efficient farming method can result in faster plant growth and higher yields. According to Martin-Laurent\net al. (1999) [\n], aeroponics technology is modern, relevant, and novel. For reforestation of\ndamaged land in humid climates, it can cultivate plants in huge quantities and tree seedlings linked to soil microorganisms, such as\nAM fungi.\nAquaponics: A sustainable hydroponics approach to the circular economy:\nIt is the method of cultivating plants and animals [often fish] close to one another. Bacteria convert noxious fish wastes like\nammonia into plant-friendly nitrates and nitrites. Aquaponics relies on fish waste as its primary food supply; thus, understanding\nthis concept is essential. In turn, the plants filter the water, making it safe for the fish. This approach is beneficial since it\nhelps save money and biological resources by reducing waste [\nAI-Driven Hydroponics:\nGlenn Dbritto et al. have researched land and water conservation using an artificial intelligence system in the hydroponic\ncultivation of Tomato F1 hybrid Suhyana seed. The system provides a controlled environment where a combination of water, nutrient\nsolution, and light is autonomously supplied to the plant roots. This approach aims to optimize plant growth while minimizing water\nusage and promoting sustainable land use practices [\n]. A Deep neural network (DNN) was\nimplemented in a study by Mehra et al., to regulate the hydroponic system's efficacy parameters (environmental conditions)\n]. Sensors linked to both an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi 4 have been integrated into a\nprototype indoor IoT-based hydroponic control system for the nutrient film technique; to automatically adjust and manage the nutrient\nand pH levels in the study system [\n]. A recent study conducted by Sun Park involved the\ndevelopment and implementation of an integrated system that utilizes IoT-Edge-AI-Cloud to track environmental data in strawberry\nhydroponics to identify optimal harvest times. The monitoring system is suggested to gather, organize, and visualize data related to\nthe circumstances in which strawberries are grown. Additionally, a deep learning algorithm was utilized to classify the maturity level\nof strawberries in images. An integrated interface was employed to visualize the monitoring and analysis results, offering fundamental\ndata for strawberry cultivation. Authors demand that even if the area used for strawberry farming grows, the suggested system, which\nis based on a virtualized container and the IoT-Edge-AI-Cloud idea, may be readily scaled and flexible. The hydroponic strawberry\natmosphere was monitored for 4 months to verify the effectiveness of the monitoring system. Furthermore, the verification of the\nharvesting was decided by utilizing strawberry images obtained from Smart Berry Farm [\nFactors involved in an effective hydroponic system:\nFactors affecting seed germination and seedling establishment for hydroponics system:\nRegulated farming, specifically greenhouse food crop production, has been identified as a highly intensive form of cultivation that\ncan effectively tackle the challenges of climate change, freshwater scarcity, and the increasing demand for food. The primary concern\nin the context of seedlings pertains to the challenge of insufficient germination and emergence. Controlling the factors that\ninfluence seed germination can improve crop development and reduce production costs by enhancing seed germination and emergence\n]. Factors influencing seed germination are tabulated in\nTable 2\nTable 2. Factors affecting Seed germination.\nFactors\nEffect on Seed Germination\nTemperature:\nThe germination of seeds is dependent on specific temperature conditions. The germination of plant species is influenced by the temperature range that is most suitable for their growth. Research has shown that ensuring appropriate temperature conditions can enhance the speed and consistency of seed germination. Maintaining the appropriate temperature for specific seeds during germination in a hydroponic system is crucial to monitoring [\nLight:\nThe importance of light in the process of seed germination and early seedling development has been widely recognized in the field of plant research. It has been observed that the germination process of most seeds is triggered by exposure to light, while some seeds may require a period of darkness to initiate germination. The optimal intensity and duration of light are crucial factors in hydroponic systems. Artificial grow lights, such as LED or fluorescent lights, can provide the seedlings with the required light energy [\nWater and Moisture\nHydroponic systems rely on water as the primary medium for delivering plant nutrients. Adequate water availability and moisture levels are critical for seed germination. Ensuring the seeds are consistently moist but not overly saturated is important, as excess water can lead to rotting or damping-off diseases. Maintaining an appropriate moisture balance in the growing medium is vital for successful seedling establishment. Wetting the chosen medium before planting the seeds is recommended without soaking it excessively. In order to achieve successful germination, it is crucial to maintain a consistent moisture level for the seeds. However, it is important to note that excessive water can impede the growth of the initial shoots and roots, ultimately hindering the establishment of the plant. It is also recommended to maintain a consistently moist environment for the medium during the germination process and the initial days following sprouting. Overwatering must be avoided to prevent medium saturation [\nOxygen\nOxygen availability is a crucial aspect that affects seed germination and root development in hydroponic systems. The respiration process of seeds necessitates oxygen, and oxygen in the growth medium is a critical factor in ensuring the successful establishment of healthy seedlings. Using an inert growing medium, such as perlite, vermiculite, or rockwool, is common in hydroponic systems. This method facilitates optimal oxygen exchange. Adequate oxygen supply to the roots is crucial to nutrient solution aeration. [\nNutrients:\nAlthough seeds possess certain nutrients to facilitate their initial growth, further nutrients are necessary for the healthy development of seedlings. A balanced nutrient solution is required in hydroponic systems, which should contain essential macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, along with micronutrients like iron, zinc, and manganese, in appropriate concentrations. Optimal seedling growth can be supported by ensuring a proper nutrient balance and maintaining the desired pH level of the nutrient solution [\npH Level:\nThe measurement of acidity or alkalinity in a solution is commonly referred to as pH. Plants' optimal growth depends on their specific pH requirements, which vary among plant species. Maintaining an appropriate pH range within the nutrient solution is crucial for successful germination and establishment of seedlings in a hydroponic system. Research has shown that the optimal pH range for most plants is slightly acidic to neutral, with a range of approximately 5.5 to 6.5. Frequent monitoring and adjustment of the pH level in the nutrient solution is crucial in establishing an ideal growth environment for the seeds [\nSeed Quality:\nThe role of seed quality and viability is crucial in determining the success of germination. Using premium seeds from trustworthy sources enhances the probability of prosperous germination and seedling establishment. In order to maximize the germination potential of seeds, it is important to use fresh, disease-free, and properly stored seeds [\nOpen in a new tab\nEffect of support system for plant growth in a hydroponic system:\nRockwool: Rockwool has been identified as a commonly used growing medium in hydroponic systems. The material under consideration is\nproduced by melting rock and spinning it into fibres. Its notable properties include high water retention capacity and adequate\naeration. The use of Rockwool has been found to provide a stable structure for root development, which in turn promotes efficient\nnutrient uptake. The versatility and accessibility of this substance make it suitable for various plant species\n]. Coco coir: Using coco coir as a growing medium is a sustainable and eco-friendly\npractice, given that it is derived from coconut husks. The material under investigation exhibits favourable water retention\ncharacteristics and facilitates adequate aeration. The use of coco coir has been found to have a positive impact on root growth, as\nwell as creating a favourable habitat for beneficial microbial activity. The capacity to buffer nutrient solutions is a recognized\ncharacteristic of the subject, which guarantees the appropriate nutrient supply to the plants [\nPeat moss: Peat moss is a frequently utilized growth substrate in hydroponic systems. The material exhibits exceptional water-holding\nproperties and demonstrates a high capacity for moisture retention. Improper soil management can lead to compaction, which can impede\nthe growth of roots. The acidity of peat moss necessitates careful monitoring and adjustment of the nutrient solution's pH. Adding\nperlite or vermiculite is a common practice to enhance aeration in the medium [\n]. Expanded\nclay pellets: The lightweight and aerating properties of expanded clay pellets, also referred to as hydroton or clay pebbles, are\nmaking them highly interested in the hydroponics field now. Additionally, these pellets have been noted to provide effective drainage.\nThey exhibit a pH value of 7, indicating a neutral nature. Furthermore, it displays a notable resistance to degradation and does not\nundergo breakdown over extended periods. Using clay pellets is prevalent in hydroponic systems that operate through flood and drain\n(ebb and flow) mechanisms. Plant roots require stability and efficient oxygen exchange, which specific structures can facilitate. The\nwater-holding capacity of these materials is limited, which may necessitate more frequent irrigation [\nSponge: Sponges and foam cubes have been identified as common support systems utilized in aeroponic or nutrient film technique (NFT)\nhydroponic systems. Providing a stable structure for seed germination and root development is crucial to plant growth and development.\nAccording to studies, sponges exhibit notable water retention capabilities and can retain nutrient solutions near roots. They also\nfacilitate adequate aeration and prevention of waterlogging. The maintenance of sponges may necessitate meticulous observation to\navoid desiccation or excessive saturation. Biochar: Biochar production involves subjecting organic matter to high temperatures in an\noxygen-free environment, producing carbon-rich material with a porous structure. The material exhibits outstanding characteristics of\nwater retention and aeration. Research has shown that applying biochar can enhance the capacity of the root zone to retain nutrients\nand promote microbial activity. Moisture regulation is one of the benefits of this technique, which also mitigates the risk of\noverwatering. The low nutrient-holding capacity of the soil may necessitate supplementary fertilization\n].

Which in turn can be broadly classified into\nmacronutrients and micronutrients? The importance of both for the nourishment and growth of plants cannot be overstated. This includes\nmacro-nutrients like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, calcium, and magnesium and micro-nutrients\nlike iron, manganese, zinc, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, copper, and nickel. Plants acquire carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen through\nnatural means, specifically from the air and water they consume, with the remainder obtained from the soil. The roots obtain nutrients\nfrom nutrient solutions or aggregate media in hydroponic systems. Research has shown that hydroponic systems are comparatively less\ntolerant than soil-based systems, and any issues related to nutrients can rapidly manifest plant symptoms. The criticality of the\nnutrient solution composition and regular monitoring of the nutrient solution and plant nutrient status is a significant aspect to\nconsider. The major salt deficiencies that a hydroponic system may encounter include nitrogen, calcium, iron, magnesium, and boron\ndeficiencies. The detrimental effects of soluble salts have been attributed to various factors, including but not limited to\nover-fertilization, suboptimal water quality, gradual accumulation of salts in the aggregate media, and inadequate drainage.\nInsufficient leaching during the process of fertigation in Hydroponics can lead to the accumulation of soluble salts in the medium due\nto water evaporation [\n]. Nutrient antagonism and interaction is a crucial parameter that\nwarrants serious consideration in the context of hydroponic systems. Research suggests that plants tend to absorb nutrients\nproportionally to their presence in the nutrient solution. The phenomenon of nutrient uptake in excess leading to a higher uptake of\none nutrient at the cost of yet another has been observed and is classified as nutrient antagonism. The nutrient levels in the\nnutrient solution may not necessarily guarantee optimal plant growth and development. Despite sufficient nutrient supply, plant\nnutrient deficiency may still occur [\n]. Some\nmajor nutrients significance has been discussed below.\nNitrogen deficiency:\nIn instances of nitrogen deficiency, the colour of leaves may change to a lighter shade of green or, in severe cases, a yellow hue.\nObservations can be made from stunted development and discolouration, specifically a slight purple tint, on the stems and undersides\nof leaves. Whereas if the feeding solution includes excessive nitrogen, roots become stunted, causing blossoming to be delayed\nBoron Deficiency:\nBoron deficits are rare and often accompany calcium shortages, mainly in the case of plant's deficit with water. Boron generally\nimproves root uptake of potassium and phosphorus and keeps plant cell walls intact and functioning [\nXin Song and colleagues studied hydroponic sugar beetroot growth and yield to determine the impact of Boron (B) depletion. Sugar\nbeetroot seedlings' SLW and root-shoot ratio increased after exposure to a Boron deficit for 14 days. Enzyme activities such as\nperoxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase have decreased due to this deficiency, whereas malonaldehyde and proline have\nincreased. Oxidative stress was caused by the accumulation of ROS in plant cells and the subsequent loss of antioxidant enzyme\nperformance. According to this research, a lack of boron can negatively impact a plant's development and structure\nMagnesium Deficiency:\nHydroponic production requires a full hydroponic nutrient solution, which includes Mg as one of the key ingredients. Mg\ninsufficiency can be made worse by nutritional inconsistencies. Magnesium (Mg) uptake can be blocked by certain ions, such as Ca and\nK. Higher levels of either Ca or K can inhibit Mg uptake; therefore, the standard goal ratio is 2:1 for Ca:Mg and 4:1 for K:Mg. Mg\ndeficiency can also be caused by a few other, less frequent factors, including a cool root zone or a stunted root system due to\nillness or waterlogging. As Mg is poorly accessible at low pH (e.g., pH less than 5), a low substrate pH can also lead to Mg\ninsufficiency [\n]. However, in their study on cormrbid conditions of Mg deficiency in mulberry\nplants, Rajesh Kumar Tewari et al., has implicated the induction of oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in these plants due to\nMg deficiency in a hydroponic condition oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in mulberry plants. They have also reported a\nsignificant decrease in H2O2 production in Mg deficit plants.\nIron Deficiency:\nAn alkaline soil growing system similar to that found in sugar beet fields was created by buffering the hydroponic medium with\nsodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to characterize iron deficiency. The study claimed that the in vivo ability for Fe3+-chelate decrease\nboosted substantially in both Fe efficient genotypes (NB1 and NB1xNB4) but less than two times in the Fe inefficient genotype (NB4).\nIt was found that the distribution and period of enhanced Fe3+-chelate decline capacity were contingent on the Fe efficiency integrity\nof individual genetic makeup [\n]. In another study, Low Fe levels influence pigment and\nmicronutrient contents of chile pepper (\nCapsicum annuum\nL.) were studied through a hydroponic system. It was found\nthat the total extractable pigments of red fruits and their surface colour remained unaffected by iron treatment. However, leaf Fe and\nFe ++ were directly proportional to iron supplement, on the other hand, indirectly proportional to copper, phosphorus, and zinc\nconcentrations in the leaf [\npH level of nutrient solution:\npH indicates the solution's acidity or alkalinity. 0-14, with 7 neutrals. Maintaining nutrition solution pH levels in the optimal\nrange increases nutrient availability. Soilless culture nutrient solutions should have a pH between 5 and 7 (typically 5.5) as they\nare weakly neutralized and needs automated pH adjustment to keep the root environment between 6 and 6.5 [\n]. Even though Phosphorous\n(H2PO4 to HPO4) buffers pH, pH between 1 to 10 mM, it is harmful to plants. A circulating solution with around 0.05 mM has\nsubstantially less buffering power than the new replenishment mixture that replaces transpiration losses because plants actively\nabsorb phosphorus [\n]. Nutrients commonly employed in nutrient solutions of hydroponic growing\nsystems, their functions, and the diseases associated with their deficiency in plants are tabulated in\nTable 4\nTable 4.

Through this process, plants convert light energy into chemical energy, which is then utilized to support their\nmetabolic processes and promote growth. Artificial lighting systems such as LED lights can be utilized in smart Hydroponics to\nregulate light's intensity, spectrum, and duration meticulously. The optimization of light settings is a crucial factor in plant\ngrowth, as it enables growers to provide the appropriate amount and quality of light that is required for each growth stage. The\nlight requirements of plants vary depending on the species, with some requiring specific amounts of red and blue light. Light\nregulation in smart Hydroponics is crucial for providing plants with adequate energy for photosynthesis, which leads to healthy\ngrowth, strong development, and enhanced yield [\nTemperature:\nTemperature plays a significant role in plant growth and metabolic processes. In smart Hydroponics, the temperature can be\nprecisely regulated to create an ideal plant environment. Each plant species has an optimal temperature range for growth and\ndevelopment, including germination, root growth, and flowering. Maintaining the appropriate temperature range can enhance enzymatic\nactivity, nutrient uptake, and overall plant performance. Smart hydroponics systems often use sensors and automated controls to\nmonitor and adjust temperature levels, ensuring that plants are kept within their preferred temperature range [\nHumidity:\nThe term humidity pertains to the quantity of water vapour in the atmosphere. The careful management of humidity in smart\nHydroponics can lead to the creation of an optimal growing environment. The impact of high humidity levels on transpiration rates in\nplants has been studied, with findings suggesting potential benefits for certain plant species during the vegetative growth stage.\nResearch has shown that high humidity levels can lead to the development of fungal diseases. Low humidity has been found to cause\nrapid moisture loss in plants, potentially resulting in water stress. Incorporating humidifiers, dehumidifiers, or ventilation systems\nin smart hydroponics systems enables the maintenance of accurate humidity levels. The manipulation of humidity levels by growers can\nfacilitate an optimal environment for plants, fostering robust growth and mitigating the likelihood of pathogenic infections\n]. In smart Hydroponics, the ability to control and optimize physical factors gives growers\ngreater precision and flexibility in creating an ideal growing environment. By fine-tuning light, temperature, and humidity, growers\ncan mimic optimal conditions for specific plant species, growth stages, and environmental preferences. This level of control allows\nfor more efficient resource utilization, improved plant health, and, ultimately higher yields in hydroponic cultivation.\nAdvantages of hydroponic smart farming:\nIncreased Yield:\nPrecise control over environmental factors promotes optimal plant growth. Nutrient-rich solutions lead to healthier and more\nvigorous plants and higher yields than traditional soil-based cultivation methods.\nWater Efficiency:\nHydroponics uses up to 90% less water than soil-based farming. Recirculating systems minimize water wastage and evaporation. Water\nis efficiently delivered directly to plant roots, reducing water usage.\nSpace Efficiency:\nHydroponic systems are highly space-efficient and require less land. Vertical growing techniques maximize production in limited\nareas. Suitable for urban farming, rooftops, or areas with limited agricultural space.\nControlled Environment:\nPrecise control over light, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels is needed. Ideal growing conditions tailored to specific\nplant requirements. Year-round cultivation regardless of seasonal limitations.\nReduced Environmental Impact:\nLess land and water usage minimize the ecological footprint. Decreased need for pesticides and herbicides. Minimized soil erosion\nand nutrient runoff, preserving soil quality.\nSuperior Plant Quality:\nEnhanced nutrient delivery promotes healthy plant growth. Higher concentrations of desired compounds in herbs and medicinal plants.\nImproved flavour, aroma, and nutritional value.\nRapid Growth and Harvest:\nPlants grow faster in Hydroponics due to optimized growing conditions.

Quick\nturnaround and increased production capacity.\nDisease and Pest Control:\nSoil-free environment minimizes the risk of soil-borne diseases and pests. Easier monitoring and management of plant health.\nReduced reliance on chemical treatments.\nSustainability:\nEfficient resource utilization reduces waste and promotes sustainability. Water and nutrient recycling systems minimize\nenvironmental impact. Lower carbon footprint compared to traditional farming methods.\nFlexibility and Scalability:\nHydroponic systems can be scaled up or down to suit different needs. Versatile setups accommodate various plant species-adaptability\nto different growing environments and locations. By harnessing these advantages, Hydroponics could offer a highly efficient and\nsustainable method of cultivation, enabling growers to maximize yields, optimize plant quality, and minimize environmental impact.\nFuture Goal:\nAchieving 30% food sustainability by 2030 with only 1% arable land requires careful planning, innovation, and the implementation of\nvarious strategies. Some key considerations for achieving this goal include:\nHydroponics in hospitals:\nIntegrating mobile hydroponic systems in hospitals is a potential future direction for Hydroponics. This approach is considered\ninnovative and can improve nutrition and patient care. Culturing high-value plants rich in essential nutrients, minerals, vitamins,\nand therapeutic compounds can improve the quality of meals in hospitals. This targeted nourishment may support patients' recovery and\noverall well-being. Integrating a mobile hydroponic system with vertical farming techniques can optimize cultivation in a small area,\nallowing for efficient use of space in various settings such as roof-top gardens, balconies, or dedicated indoor spaces. Implementing\nthis approach guarantees an uninterrupted provision of superior plant specimens such as herbs, leafy greens, or medicinal plants.\nUsing these plants in cooking, teas, or extracts can serve as a natural source of remedies and supplements for patients, which may aid\nin fulfilling their dietary needs. Hydroponics provides a controlled environment that enables year-round cultivation, reducing\nreliance on seasonal produce and potential supply fluctuations.\nVertical Farming and Rooftop Gardens:\nVertical farming and rooftop gardens should be extensively explored due to the limited availability of land. Vertical farming\ninvolves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, enabling optimal utilization of space. Establishing rooftop gardens on buildings\nhas been identified as a potential method for expanding areas available for food production.\nThe practice of indoor agriculture:\nIt encompasses greenhouse systems, can facilitate crop production throughout the year while safeguarding crops from unfavourable\nweather conditions. The practice of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) entails meticulously regulating environmental variables,\nincluding light, temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentrations, to facilitate the most favourable conditions for plant growth.\nImplementing CEA technologies has potentially improved productivity and resource efficiency\nHigh-Yield Crop Selection:\nHydroponic system studies emphasize the importance of prioritizing high-yield crops that can provide maximum output within a\nconfined space. The prioritization of crops with shorter growth cycles, higher nutritional value, and greater demand is a crucial\naspect of agricultural research. This study aims to investigate and determine appropriate crop cultivars that are well-suited for the\nclimatic conditions of Singapore and can be cultivated effectively through hydroponic or other advanced agricultural methods.\nEfficient Resource Utilization:\nThe optimization of resource utilization can be achieved by implementing smart irrigation systems, water recycling, and nutrient\nmanagement strategies. Implementing techniques such as drip irrigation, fogging, or precision fertigation can reduce water and\nnutrient wastage. Research has shown that the implementation of recirculating hydroponic systems can result in a significant reduction\nin water consumption.\nAgro-technology and Automation:\nImplementing advanced agro-technology and automation can enhance productivity and decrease labour demands in the agricultural\nsector. The implementation of IoT-based systems, sensors, and data analytics are being researched to monitor and control environmental\nparameters, detect crop health issues, and optimize resource usage. Implementing automated processes, such as robotic seeding,\nharvesting, and maintenance, has the potential to address labour limitations [\n]. Sustainable Energy Sources:\nThe implementation of advanced agro-technology and automation has been shown to impact productivity and labour requirements in\nagriculture positively. Implementing IoT-based systems, sensors, and data analytics can be utilized to monitor and control\nenvironmental parameters, detect crop health issues, and optimize resource usage. Implementing automated processes, such as robotic\nseeding, harvesting, and maintenance, can potentially address labour limitations [\n]. Collaboration and Partnerships: Promoting collaboration among government agencies,\nresearch institutions, industry stakeholders, and the community is essential. Promoting knowledge sharing, research collaborations,\nand public-private partnerships is essential in driving innovation, exchanging best practices, and collectively working towards\nachieving food sustainability goals [\n]. Education and Awareness:\nThis study aims to increase public awareness and knowledge regarding food sustainability and the advantages of locally cultivated\nproduce. Research suggests that urban farming initiatives in schools, community centres, and residential areas can involve citizens\nin sustainable food production and create a sense of food security [\n]. Policy Support and Incentives:\nResearch suggests that implementing supportive policies and incentives can effectively promote urban farming initiatives. Research\nsuggests that providing grants, subsidies, tax incentives, and streamlined regulatory processes can effectively encourage investment\nin urban agriculture. The study aims to investigate the impact of policies on fostering innovation, research, and the adoption of\nsustainable farming practices [\n]. Food Waste Management: The effective management of food waste\nis a crucial area of research that requires attention. The promotion of composting, recycling, and utilising food waste as a valuable\nresource for bioenergy or fertilizers is recommended. The reduction of food waste has the potential to alleviate the burden on\nresources and foster a more sustainable food system [\n]. By\nconsidering these factors and implementing a comprehensive approach that encompasses technology, innovation, collaboration, and\nsustainable practices, locals can work towards achieving their 30% food sustainability goal by 2030, despite limited arable land\navailability.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Hydroponics holds immense promise for the future of agriculture. This innovative cultivation method offers a range\nof advantages that address the challenges faced by traditional farming practices. With its ability to maximize resource efficiency,\nenable year-round crop production, and enhance yields, Hydroponics has the potential to revolutionize the way we grow food. By\nutilizing Hydroponics, we can optimize water, nutrients, and space, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. The controlled\nenvironments of hydroponic systems allow for precise control over growing conditions, resulting in accelerated growth rates and higher\ncrop yields. This, in turn, contributes to food security, reduces dependence on imports, and increases the availability of fresh,\nlocally-grown produce. Moreover, Hydroponics offers a pathway to environmental sustainability by reducing soil erosion, minimizing\nchemical inputs, and integrating with eco-friendly pest control methods. It also opens up possibilities for urban agriculture,\nallowing for food production in limited spaces and bringing farming closer to urban centres. As technology advances, integrating smart\ntechnologies, automation, and data analytics with Hydroponics further enhances its potential. This integration enables real-time\nmonitoring, precise control, and automation of various processes, leading to greater efficiency, reduced labour requirements, and\nimprove overall productivity.\nEdited by P Kangueane\nCitation:\nRajaseger\net al.\nBioinformation 19(9):925-938(2023)\nDeclaration on Publication Ethics:\nThe author's state that they adhere with COPE guidelines on publishing ethics as described elsewhere at https://publicationethics.org/.\nThe authors also undertake that they are not associated with any other third party (governmental or non-governmental agencies) linking with any form of unethical issues connecting to this publication.

This\npractice is essential for optimizing plant growth and yields, as\nwell as minimizing the risk of damage from weather events and\npests.\nDifferent crops have varying requirements for temperature,\nsunlight, water, and soil nutrients, and seasonal cultivation takes\nthese factors into account to ensure that plants are grown at the\nmost optimal time for their growth and development. In this\narticle, we will explore some of the key aspects of seasonal\ncultivation.\nPlanting season:\nThe planting season for different crops varies\ndepending on the climate of a particular region. In general, it is\nbest to plant crops during a time when temperatures are\nfavorable for their growth and development. For example, cool\nseason crops such as lettuce, spinach, and broccoli are typically\nplanted in the spring or fall, while warm season crops such as\ntomatoes, peppers, and corn are usually planted in the summer.\nTemperature:\nTemperature plays a crucial role in seasonal\ncultivation. Plants have specific temperature requirements for\ntheir growth and development, and it is important to choose\ncrops that are well suited to the local climate. Frost sensitive\ncrops, such as tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, are usually\nplanted after the last frost date in the spring. Crops that are\ntolerant of cooler temperatures, such as leafy greens, can be\nplanted earlier in the season.\nSunlight:\nSunlight is another important factor in seasonal\ncultivation. Different crops require different amounts of sunlight\nfor their growth and development, and it is important to choose\ncrops that are well suited to the amount of sunlight available in a\nparticular region. For example, crops that require full sun, such\nas tomatoes and peppers, should be planted in areas that receive\nat least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day.\nWater:\nWater is crucial for the growth and development of\nplants. Seasonal cultivation takes into account the amount of\nrainfall in a particular region and the specific water needs of\ndifferent crops. In areas with low rainfall, irrigation may be\nnecessary to ensure that crops receive enough water for their\ngrowth and development.\nSoil nutrients:\nSoil nutrients are essential for the growth and\ndevelopment of plants. Seasonal cultivation takes into account\nthe specific nutrient needs of different crops and ensures that\nthe soil is adequately prepared before planting. This may involve\nadding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to the soil to\nimprove its fertility.\nPest management:\nPests can be a significant problem for crops,\nand seasonal cultivation takes into account the specific pests that\nare common in a particular region. This may involve planting\ncrops at a time when pests are less active, or using organic pest\ncontrol methods, such as crop rotation, companion planting,\nand biological control, to manage pests.\nIn conclusion, seasonal cultivation is a critical component of\nsuccessful crop production. By taking into account the specific\nrequirements of different crops for temperature, sunlight, water,\nsoil nutrients, and pest management, growers can optimize plant\ngrowth and yields while minimizing the risk of damage from\nweather events and pests. By choosing crops that are well suited\nto the local climate and growing conditions, growers can\nmaximize their chances of success and produce healthy, vibrant\ncrops year after year.\n--------for extracted references-----\n---------------------------\nAuthor Info\nInes Feki\nDepartment of Plant Biology, Tunis University, Tunis, Tunisia\nCitation:\nFeki I (2023) Seasonal Cultivation of Plants: An Overview.

Most patients begin to take conventional medications as soon as their diagnoses are made, so ayurvedic treatments are usually undergone alongside and/or after conventional medical approaches. A detailed knowledge of the action of food, spices, and medicinal plants is needed in order to understand their potential influence fully. While societal use of ayurvedic plants and Indian spices is commonplace, without ill effect, the use of more concentrated products made from single plants, often in the form of teas or tablets, is of more concern. The mechanisms by which polyherbal drugs and their extracts act differ in many respects from the actions of single substances or synthetic drugs. Despite the fact that ayurvedic medicines are based on natural herbal materials, their safety depends on their method of administration, taking into account individuals’ needs and their specific disease conditions.\nKeywords:\nayurvedic polyherbal medicine, action of ayurvedic plants, importance of ayurvedic plants, ayurvedic pharmacology\nTraditional Indian medicine (or ayurveda) is becoming increasingly popular in Europe, with many chronic conditions responding to it well. While conventional medicine dominates many fields in this market, it does not always outperform traditional ayurvedic approaches. Conventional medicine frequently relies on lifelong medication, on which patients come to depend. Many medications have side-effects, and withdrawal symptoms that, if the medications are later discontinued, can become problematic. In such circumstances, ayurveda has much to offer. Patients generally respond well to ayurvedic treatments, experiencing a reduction, and sometimes even a cessation, of their symptoms. Most patients begin to take conventional medications as soon as their diagnoses are made, so ayurvedic treatments are usually undergone alongside and/or after conventional medical approaches. Patients therefore tend to experience ayurveda once their conditions have progressed. Despite this, much can be done to minimize conditions’ symptoms and control their progress. Ayurveda can help improve patients’ symptoms by reducing their cortisone and analgesic usage, thereby enhancing their quality of life.\nThe public constantly seeks out new health care approaches. In this situation, ayurveda is an easy target for bogus health claims. Many of the available books are inauthentic—a product of unqualified authors’ ideas and fantasies. Short-term courses similarly vary greatly in the quality of the teaching provided and the qualifications thereby obtained. While ayurveda is becoming increasingly popular, which is a positive development, care must be taken against its mismanagement, especially given the vast array of spurious “ayurvedic” products currently on the market.\nConcepts Underpinning Ayurvedic Medicine\nTraditional Indian medicine, or ayurveda, is based on a traditional medical system, in the same way as traditional Chinese medicine, with both being developed in their respective geographic regions. Ayurvedic practice is around 3000 years old, with a long history of managing disease. The 3 basic principles, called\ndoshas\nvata\npitta\n, and\nkapha\n), are derived from 5 elements of Indian philosophy. Ayurveda’s\ndoshas\ncan be identified as regulatory control factors for fundamental physiologic processes in living systems that maintain their identity throughout biologic history:\nvata\nand its\nsubdoshas\nregulating input/output processes and motion;\npitta\nand its\nsubdoshas\nregulating throughput, turnover, and hence energy; and\nkapha\nand its\nsubdoshas\nregulating storage, structure, and lubrication.\nFactors such as food, activity, the climate and stress can, however, disrupt or destroy these functions. Ayurveda seeks to normalize body functions with varied techniques including advice on food and activity, internal herbal preparations, purification treatments (\npanchakarma\n), and surgical methods (\nshalya chikitsa\nOral administration routes play a major role in influencing individuals’\ndoshas\n, via the ingestion of food, spices, and medicinal plants. These elements are influencing\ndoshas\nin different ways: stabilizing, disturbing, and supporting the body’s healthy state. A detailed knowledge of the action of food, spices, and medicinal plants is needed in order in to understand their potential influence fully.\nAyurvedic Medicinal Plants\nAyurveda first seeks to diagnose patients’ conditions before treating them with internal preparations, diet, and habit restrictions. Plant-based preparations play a major role in the ayurvedic healing process. In broad terms, there is no substance in the world that cannot be used as a potential medicine.\nTraditional ayurvedic texts warn against the use of substances that are not adequately understood.\nAny plant, animal, or mineral substance can be incorporated into the ayurvedic pharmacopeia, but only if it is understood fully, in terms of its nomenclature, identity, properties, and applications.\nThe texts also warn against the abuse of well-known medicines, emphasizing the point that even poisons can have medicinal properties when used appropriately, whereas the best of medicines can be harmful if improperly used.\nOf nearly 10 000 plants used for medicinal purposes in the Indian subcontinent, only 1200 to 1500 have been incorporated into the official ayurvedic pharmacopeia in more than 3000 years. All plants must be studied thoroughly before becoming part of the ayurvedic pharmacopeia.\nActions of Foods, Spices, and Medicinal Plants\nThe Role of Food\nFood plays a major role in ayurvedic practice by supporting the body’s healing processes. Metabolic diseases and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are directly influenced by food. Food can also indirectly affect diseases of the skin, muscles, and joints, as well as neurological, gynecological, and psychological disease.\nInfrequent consumption is unlikely to cause a problem, but frequent consumption of inappropriate foods will cause disease or worsen existing disease. Advice on food depends not only on the disease but also on the disease condition and the\ndosha\ninvolved. Because of this, food advice may change throughout the course of a disease, depending on the stage reached. Interactions between foods and medicines are a major issue. The advice given with regard to food must take account of the medicines prescribed, otherwise potential interactions may worsen patients’ conditions.\nThe Action of Indian Spices\nThe second strongest influence on patients’\ndoshas\n, after food, is spices. Many spices are strong by nature. Spices are obtained from the roots, flowers, fruits, seeds, or bark of plants or herbs. Spices are native to warm, tropical climates. Coming from woody or herbaceous plants, spices have a different active principle, which gives them specific characters. These active principles have specific functions within the body. The phytochemicals within spices are secondary metabolites, which serve to protect the plants from damage by insects, animals, fungi, pathogens, and parasites. Before consumption, most spices are dried to degrade these chemicals. Drying also increases the resulting spices’ shelf life and potency.\nThe action of spices within the body differs according to the ways that they are used. Spices are mostly used for their natural flavor and aroma in processing food. In addition to adding taste, some spices (cumin, ginger, coriander) also have preventative effects, aiding digestion through the production of digestive enzymes. When mixed with digestive juices, these substances aid absorption. Such spices have individual effects, their actions depending on the constitution of the person concerned and their disease. Indian food is becoming increasingly popular and is often seen as healthy. From an ayurvedic perspective, healthy food is food that is used in a healthy way. From this viewpoint, spicy and pungent foods are not necessarily “good” foods. Indian food is not automatically ayurvedic, because the latter insists that individual’s health situation be taken into account. People with gastric hyperacidity or gastric or intestinal inflammation may find their health worsened by exposure to some Indian spices.\nAyurvedic Medicinal Plants\nApproximately 90% of ayurvedic preparations are plant based. Ayurvedic plants have a stronger action on the body than either food or spices. Such actions enable the plant to reverse pathophysiological processes and stabilize the\ndoshas\n. For this reason, one should use such plants with caution. Classical ayurvedic preparations, made from such plants, are known as “yoga” in Sanskrit. Yogas have developed following years’ of practical experience combining plants to get the optimal effect.\nPolyherbal combinations have also proven lastingly effective than single herbs. In ayurveda, most of the classical preparations are polyherbal, with a combination of 3 to 30 plants involved. These constituents are combined accurately, in such a way that the formula is balanced and reproducible. One or two of the plants in these combinations will be active and the others will play a supporting role. The supporting herbs will each have different actions, acting as catalysts to help proper absorption, transportation, and to reduce toxicity. If an ideal combination is delivered, then the result can be excellent, but such outcomes are based on thorough plant knowledge (see\nFigure 1\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nConcept of the increasingly intense influence of food, spices, and medicinal plants on the body.\nAyurvedic Plants: Misuse and Self-Medication\nWhile societal use of ayurvedic plants and Indian spices is commonplace, without ill effect, the use of more concentrated products made from single plants, often in the form of teas or tablets, is of more concern. Ayurvedic plants are generally seen as safe and free from side effects, which is not always true.\nTable 1\nlists some undesirable effects of improper use of ayurvedic herbs. Some of the common plants sold in the market are\ntulsi\nFigure 2\nguduchi\nFigure 3\n), and\npippali\nFigure 4\nTable 1.\nEffects and Side Effects of Commonly Propagated Ayurvedic Herbs in the Market.\nHerbs/Plants\nAyurvedic Perspective\nResults of Improper Usage\nCurcuma\n/turmeric\nAnti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic actions\nPungent and bitter in taste (\nkatu\ntikta\n), dry in quality (\nguna\n), hot in potency (\nveerya\n), and pungent in its postdigestive taste (\nvipaka\n).

Most owe their flavoring properties to volatile oils, and some to fixed oils and small amount of resin, known as oleoresins. Spices’ flavor is due to a blend of compounds, including alcohols, phenols, esters, terpenes, organic acids, resins, alkaloids, and sulfur-containing compounds, in various proportions.\nIn addition to these flavoring components, each spice contains components such as proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, minerals, tannins, and polyphenols. Some of the phytochemicals in commonly used spices are toxic to humans, unless the spices concerned are first dried under shade or sun. Drying serves to evaporate volatile phytochemicals.\nTurmeric should not be used in raw form, for this reason. It has been found to control a variety of agricultural and animal pests—its bioactive constituents interfering with insect behavior and growth. Products containing turmeric have also been found useful as insect repellents and insecticides.\nGinger\nPungent taste, be light and unctuous in quality, hot in potency and sweet postdigestion; help reduce patients’\nkapha\nand\nvata\nand increases their\npitta\nPeople who take ginger regularly, in\npitta\ncondition, or having\npitta prakruti\n, may develop\npitta\n-related problems.

From an ayurvedic perspective, diseases certainly seem to arise from the improper function of these 3\ndoshas\n. Ancient texts list 80\nvata\ndiseases, 40\npitta\ndiseases, and 20\nkapha\ndiseases. The more recent recognition of new diseases should make this number even higher. The complex pathophysiology of modern disease means that the symptoms that individuals experience are always a combination of 2 or 3\ndoshas\n. This complexity means that ayurvedic preparations must be equally complex. In the classics, 63 major combinations of\ndoshas\nhave been listed and this complexity needs to be considered to elicit therapeutic effects. For example, migraine, low back pain, or arthritis of the knee can occur from\nvata\nimbalance. These diseases have different pathophysiological mechanisms, manifesting themselves in different body regions. To treat these conditions, drugs that act on the selected region are chosen. Compounds made from groups of plants are then combined in prescribed ways to achieve the desired effects. This means that undifferentiated concepts of\nvata\npitta\n-, and\nkapha\n-related teas are nonsensical. Most of the above-mentioned teas contain a variety of nonspecific, commonly used, spices. While these teas can certainly be consumed for refreshment purposes, they will not cure disease.\nThe Rationale for Ayurvedic Formulations and Actions\nAyurvedic products are mainly composed of herbal combinations.\nIn certain parts of India, ayurvedic formulations also contain heavy metals. Traditional texts such as\nCharaka Samhitha\nSusrutha Samhitha\n, and\nAshtanga Samgraha\ndo not describe the use of heavy metals—clearly this is a later development. Heavy metals are toxic and are not permitted at any level in modern pharmaceuticals. By contrast, in ayurvedic preparations, metals may be added for their perceived therapeutic effects to form\nrasausadhies\n(herbo-bio-mineral metallic preparations). In ayurveda, the use of metals and minerals as medicines have been recommended only after purification (\nshodhana\n) and that with recommended low dose, with specific vehicle (\nanupana\n), for a particular period and obeying dos and donts in relation to diet, activities, and environment. Ayurveda has also described the toxic effect, complications, and diseases caused due to ingestion of raw or improperly processed metallic preparations. Researches have revealed the metal content in a number of ayurvedic\nrasausadhies\nand toxicity cases due to ayurvedic herbal consumptions have been reported throughout the last decade, especially those sold through the Internet.\nSuch metals are not found in pure herbal ayurvedic preparations.\nTraditional ayurvedic texts note that quality-assured ayurvedic compounds are strong and potent enough to combat disease. The parts of the plants chosen for use are also important. Depending on the plants concerned, and the medical combinations involved, the leaves, flowers, seeds, bark, roots, or skin of the plant may be chosen. The particular combination chosen results from extensive practical experience of the constituents needed to achieve the maximal effect. The mechanisms by which polyherbal drugs and their extracts act differ in many respects from the actions of single substances or synthetic drugs.\nPolyherbalism has its roots in the earliest texts of ayurveda like\nCaraka Samhita\nSusrutha Samhitha\nAshtanga Hrudaya\n, which systematizes the pharmaceutical procedures. The traditional Ayurvedic text\nSarangdhar Samhita\n, which dates from 1300 AD, highlights the concept of polyherbalism in this ancient medical system.\nMost ayurvedic formulations are polyherbal.\nWhile the active phytochemical constituents of individual plants are well established, they are usually present only in minute amounts and are, thus, insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effects.\nRecent research shows that combining plants of varying potency enhances their effect, both when compared to individual plant use and also to the sum of their individual effect. This phenomenon is known as synergy. Some pharmacological actions, from the active constituents of some herbs, have proven to be significant only when potentiated by those of other plants, but are not evident when used alone.\nTwo mechanisms have been proposed for these actions: pharmacokinetic synergy and pharmacodynamic synergy.\nThe former is based on herbs’ perceived ability to facilitate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of other herbs. The latter concerns the synergistic effect of active constituents with similar therapeutic actions targeting similar receptors or physiological systems. Most diseases are caused by a multiplicity of factors, leading to both visible and invisible symptoms. A combination of herbs may act on multiple targets at the same time to provide thorough relief.\nThere is a misconception that ayurvedic preparations, being natural, are always safe. This is untrue.\nCharaka Samhita\nnotes that ayurvedic medicines have adverse effects when prepared and/or used inappropriately.\nAyurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India sets standards of drugs/ingredients mentioned in different formulations of Ayurvedic Formulary of India. There are also 56 referral texts described under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Apart from these, there have been several other ayurvedic texts written during 1000 BC to 19th century. The numbers of medicinal plants have gradually increased from the Vedic period to modern era inducting more number of indigenous medicinal plants as well as exotic plants. The\nCharaka Samhita\nstresses the factors to be considered when selecting formulations’ constituents, including plants’ habitat, the season in which they grow, the prevailing harvesting conditions, the selected method of storage, and the chosen method of pharmaceutical processing.\nHowever, herbs are natural materials, and their constituents may vary due to differing geographical locations, climatic conditions, environmental hazards, harvesting methods, and collection protocols. Such factors make it difficult to standardize or reproduce the quality of the end product.\nThe concept of bioavailability is broadly defined as the absorption and utilization of a nutrient.\nThe degree and quantity of penetration of a herbal drug, or its active ingredients, is determined by its bioavailability.\nBioavailability can depend on the chemical complexity of an herb, due to the synergistic and antagonistic actions of its constituents, in promoting absorption. A drug’s hydrophobic properties determine its ability to cross the luminal wall, as do the gut microflora, patients’ liver function, and the chemical modifications made by the herbal constituents. Herbal drugs must cross the blood-brain barrier if they are to affect the central nervous system, but there is a dearth of literature on Indian herbs, especially ones with potential antioxidant-stimulating properties, on this important topic.\nThe synergistic interactions of herbs can play an important role in their bioavailability. Long pepper, black pepper, and ginger can all increase the bioavailability of some compounds.\nPerson-to-person variation in gut micro flora and hepatic activity also play a role in systemic absorption.\nMethods of Drug Administration in Ayurveda\nDrug administration methods differ in ayurveda and conventional modern medicine. In the latter, most medications are synthetic; their administration influences the stomach and intestine. Most conventional medications are thus administered after food. Ayurveda has narrated timings of medication according to the patient’s nature, disease, and the condition of disease. Ayurvedic preparations are also administered on empty stomach. As the latter preparations are plant-based, they are slow-acting. The absorption of ayurvedic plant preparations occurs as part of normal metabolism. Ayurvedic preparations must be broken down for digestion in the gastrointestinal tract and has to get digested in the stomach and intestine, before getting into blood circulation and before reaching the target organ and bring about treatment action. For ayurvedic physicians, patients’ digestive strength is thus important. Ayurvedic preparations must undergo many digestive processes before being absorbed as part of normal metabolism. Ayurvedic physicians therefore analyze their patients’ metabolic state before treatment, as a matter of course, aiming for optimal stability and the least gastrointestinal damage.\nAyurvedic medicines exist in different formats, including decoctions, powders, pastes, fermented products, tablets, and medicinal butters (ghees). The formats used, whether liquids, pastes or tablets, are linked to preparations’ efficacy. If the format is changed, then the desired effect may be lost and potential side effects created. The parts of the plants used as ingredients are also very important. Sometimes, ayurvedic preparations are administered alongside other natural products, such as honey, salt, or milk, to get specific actions, according to the disease condition experienced. In Sanskrit, these natural products are termed\nAnupana\n. These natural products also help minimize any side effects. The timing of ayurveda preparations also varies according to the specific disease and its condition.\nConclusion\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that many factors must be considered in prescribing or taking ayurvedic medicine. Despite the fact that ayurvedic medicines are based on natural herbal materials, their safety depends on their method of administration, taking account of individuals’ needs and their specific disease conditions. The unguided consumption of ayurvedic preparations, in the mistaken belief that spices and herbs will necessarily be safe, may lead to serious health issues. A thorough awareness of these plants’ actions is needed for their safe selection and consumption.\nFootnotes\nAuthors’ Note:\nThe article was written at the office of Syal Kumar with the guidance of Prof Gustav J.

The connection between man and his search for drugs in nature dates from the far past, of which there is ample evidence from various sources: written documents, preserved monuments, and even original plant medicines. Awareness of medicinal plants usage is a result of the many years of struggles against illnesses due to which man learned to pursue drugs in barks, seeds, fruit bodies, and other parts of the plants. Contemporary science has acknowledged their active action, and it has included in modern pharmacotherapy a range of drugs of plant origin, known by ancient civilizations and used throughout the millennia. The knowledge of the development of ideas related to the usage of medicinal plants as well as the evolution of awareness has increased the ability of pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges that have emerged with the spreading of professional services in facilitation of man's life.\nKeywords:\nHistory, medicinal plants, plant drugs, usage\nINTRODUCTION\nEver since ancient times, in search for rescue for their disease, the people looked for drugs in nature. The beginnings of the medicinal plants’ use were instinctive, as is the case with animals.[\n] In view of the fact that at the time there was not sufficient information either concerning the reasons for the illnesses or concerning which plant and how it could be utilized as a cure, everything was based on experience. In time, the reasons for the usage of specific medicinal plants for treatment of certain diseases were being discovered; thus, the medicinal plants’ usage gradually abandoned the empiric framework and became founded on explicatory facts. Until the advent of iatrochemistry in 16th century, plants had been the source of treatment and prophylaxis.[\n] Nonetheless, the decreasing efficacy of synthetic drugs and the increasing contraindications of their usage make the usage of natural drugs topical again.\nHISTORICAL SOURCES RELEVANT FOR STUDY OF MEDICINAL PLANTS’ USE\nThe oldest written evidence of medicinal plants’ usage for preparation of drugs has been found on a Sumerian clay slab from Nagpur, approximately 5000 years old. It comprised 12 recipes for drug preparation referring to over 250 various plants, some of them alkaloid such as poppy, henbane, and mandrake.[\nThe Chinese book on roots and grasses “Pen T’Sao,” written by Emperor Shen Nung circa 2500 BC, treats 365 drugs (dried parts of medicinal plants), many of which are used even nowadays such as the following:\nRhei rhisoma\n, camphor,\nTheae folium, Podophyllum\n, the great yellow gentian, ginseng, jimson weed, cinnamon bark, and ephedra.[\nThe Indian holy books Vedas mention treatment with plants, which are abundant in that country. Numerous spice plants used even today originate from India: nutmeg, pepper, clove, etc.[\nThe Ebers Papyrus, written circa 1550 BC, represents a collection of 800 proscriptions referring to 700 plant species and drugs used for therapy such as pomegranate, castor oil plant, aloe, senna, garlic, onion, fig, willow, coriander, juniper, common centaury, etc.[\nAccording to data from the Bible and the holy Jewish book the Talmud, during various rituals accompanying a treatment, aromatic plants were utilized such as myrtle and incense.[\nIn Homer's epics The Iliad and The Odysseys, created circa 800 BC, 63 plant species from the Minoan, Mycenaean, and Egyptian Assyrian pharmacotherapy were referred to. Some of them were given the names after mythological characters from these epics; for instance, Elecampane (\nInula helenium\nL. Asteraceae) was named in honor of Elena, who was the centre of the Trojan War. As regards the plants from the genus\nArtemisia\n, which were believed to restore strength and protect health, their name was derived from the Greek word\nartemis\n, meaning “healthy.”[\n] Herodotus (500 BC) referred to castor oil plant, Orpheus to the fragrant hellebore and garlic, and Pythagoras to the sea onion (\nScilla maritima\n), mustard, and cabbage. The works of Hippocrates (459–370 BC) contain 300 medicinal plants classified by physiological action: Wormwood and common centaury (\nCentaurium umbellatum Gilib\n) were applied against fever; garlic against intestine parasites; opium, henbane, deadly nightshade, and mandrake were used as narcotics; fragrant hellebore and haselwort as emetics; sea onion, celery, parsley, asparagus, and garlic as diuretics; oak and pomegranate as adstringents.[\nTheophrast (371-287 BC) founded botanical science with his books “De Causis Plantarium”— Plant Etiology and “De Historia Plantarium”—Plant History. In the books, he generated a classification of more than 500 medicinal plants known at the time.[\n] Among others, he referred to cinnamon, iris rhizome, false hellebore, mint, pomegranate, cardamom, fragrant hellebore, monkshood, and so forth. In the description of the plant toxic action, Theophrast underscored the important feature for humans to become accustomed to them by a gradual increase of the doses. Owing to his consideration of the said topics, he gained the epithet of “the father of botany,” given that he has great merits for the classification and description of medicinal plants.[\nIn his work “\nDe re medica\n” the renowned medical writer Celsus (25 BC–50 AD) quoted approximately 250 medicinal plants such as aloe, henbane, flax, poppy, pepper, cinnamon, the star gentian, cardamom, false hellebore, etc.[\nIn ancient history, the most prominent writer on plant drugs was Dioscorides, “the father of pharmacognosy,” who, as a military physician and pharmacognosist of Nero's Army, studied medicinal plants wherever he travelled with the Roman Army. Circa 77 AD he wrote the work “De Materia Medica.” This classical work of ancient history, translated many times, offers plenty of data on the medicinal plants constituting the basic\nmateria medica\nuntil the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.[\n] Of the total of 944 drugs described, 657 are of plant origin, with descriptions of the outward appearance, locality, mode of collection, making of the medicinal preparations, and their therapeutic effect. In addition to the plant description, the names in other languages coupled with the localities where they occur or are grown are provided. The plants having mild effect are dominant, but there are also references to those containing alkaloid or other matter with strong effect (fragrant hellebore, false hellebore, poppy, buttercup, jimson weed, henbane, deadly nightshade).[\n] Dioscorides’ most appreciated domestic plants are as follows: willow, camomile, garlic, onion, marsh mallow, ivy, nettle, sage, common centaury, coriander, parsley, sea onion, and false hellebore). Camomile (\nMatricaria recucita\nL.), known under the name Chamaemelon, is used as an antiphlogistic to cure wounds, stings, burns, and ulcers, then for cleansing and rinsing the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Owing to its mild carminative action, it is particularly appropriate for usage with children. Dioscorides deemed that it had abortive action, on which he wrote, “The flower, root, and the entire plant accelerate menstruation, the release of the embryo, and the discharge of urine and stone, provided that they are used in the form of an infusion and baths.” This untrue belief was later embraced by both the Romans and the Arabs; hence the Latin name\nMatricaria\n, derived from two words:\nmater\ndenoting “mother,” i.e. matrix, denoting ‘uterus’. Dioscorides differentiated between a number of species from the genus\nMentha\n, which were grown and used to relieve headache and stomach ache. The bulbs of sea onion and parsley were utilized as diuretics, oak bark was used for gynaecological purposes, while white willow was used as an antipyretic. As maintained by Dioscorides,\nScillae bulbus\nwas also applied as an expectorant, cardiac stimulant, and antihydrotic.[\n] It is worth underscoring that Dioscorides pointed to the possibility of forgery of drugs, both the domestic ones such as opium forged by a yellow poppy (\nGlaucium flavum\n) milk sap and poppy, and the more expensive oriental drugs, transported by the Arab merchants from the Far East, such as iris, calamus, caradmomum, incense, etc.[\nPliny the Elder (23 AD-79), a contemporary of Dioscorides, who travelled throughout Germany and Spain, wrote about approximately 1000 medicinal plants in his book “Historia naturalis.” Pliny's and Dioscorides’ works incorporated all knowledge of medicinal plants at the time.[\nThe most distinguished Roman physician (concurrently a pharmacist), Galen (131 AD–200), compiled the first list of drugs with similar or identical action (parallel drugs), which are interchangeable—“De succedanus.” From today's point of view, some of the proposed substitutes do not correspond in a pharmacological context and are absolutely unacceptable. Galen also introduced several new plant drugs in therapy that Dioscorides had not described, for instance,\nUvae ursi folium\n, used as an uroantiseptic and a mild diuretic even in this day and age.\nIn the seventh century AD the Slavic people used\nRosmarinus officinalis, Ocimum basilicum, Iris germanica\n, and\nMentha viridis\nin cosmetics,\nAlium sativum\nas a remedy and\nVeratrum album, Cucumis sativus, Urtica dioica, Achilea millefolium, Artemisia maritime\nL.,\nLavandula officinalis, Sambuci flos\nagainst several injurios insects, i.e. louses, fleas, moths, mosquitos, and spiders and\nAconitum napellus\nas a poison in hunting.[\nIn the Middle Ages, the skills of healing, cultivation of medicinal plants, and preparation of drugs moved to monasteries. Therapy was based on 16 medicinal plants, which the physicians-monks commonly grew within the monasteries as follows: sage, anise, mint, Greek seed, savory, tansy, etc.\nCharles the Great (742 AD–814), the founder of the reputed medical school in Salerno, in his “Capitularies” ordered which medicinal plants were to be grown on the state-owned lands. Around 100 different plants were quoted, which have been used till present days such as sage, sea onion, iris, mint, common centaury, poppy, marsh mallow, etc. The great emperor especially appreciated the sage (\nSalvia officinalis\nL.). The Latin name of sage originates from the old Latins, who called it a salvation plant (\nsalvare\nmeaning “save, cure”). Even today sage is a mandatory plant in all Catholic monasteries.[\nThe Arabs introduced numerous new plants in pharmacotherapy, mostly from India, a country they used to have trade relations with, whereas the majority of the plants were with real medicinal value, and they have persisted in all pharmacopoeias in the world till today. The Arabs used aloe, deadly nightshade, henbane, coffee, ginger, strychnos, saffron, curcuma, pepper, cinnamon, rheum, senna, and so forth. Certain drugs with strong action were replaced by drugs with mild action, for instance,\nSennae folium\nwas used as a mild laxative, compared to the purgatives\nHeleborus odorus\nand\nEuphorbium\nused until then.\nThroughout the Middle Ages European physicians consulted the Arab works “De Re Medica” by John Mesue (850 AD), “Canon Medicinae” by Avicenna (980-1037), and “Liber Magnae Collectionis Simplicum Alimentorum Et Medicamentorum” by Ibn Baitar (1197-1248), in which over 1000 medicinal plants were described.[\nFor Macedonia, St Clement and St Naum of Ohrid's work are of particular significance. They referred to the Nikeian pharmacological codex dating from year 850, and transferred his extensive knowledge on medicinal plants to his disciples and via them to the masses.[\nMarco Polo's journeys (1254-1324) in tropical Asia, China, and Persia, the discovery of America (1492), and Vasco De Gama's journeys to India (1498), resulted in many medicinal plants being brought into Europe. Botanical gardens emerged all over Europe, and attempts were made for cultivation of domestic medicinal plants and of the ones imported from the old and the new world. With the discovery of America, materia medica was enriched with a large number of new medicinal plants:\nCinchona, Ipecacuanha, Cacao, Ratanhia, Lobelia, Jalapa, Podophylum, Senega, Vanilla, Mate\n, tobacco, red pepper, etc. In 17th century,\nCortex Chinae\n, yielded from quinine bark\nCinchona succirubra\nPavon, under the name countess’ powder, since the Countess of Chinchon was the first one who used it, was introduced to European medicine. Quinine bark rapidly overwhelmed England, France, and Germany despite the fact that there was many an opponent to its use among distinguished physicians—members of a range of academies.\nParacelsus (1493-1541) was one of the proponents of chemically prepared drugs out of raw plants and mineral substances; nonetheless, he was a firm believer that the collection of those substances ought to be astrologically determined. He continuously emphasized his belief in observation, and simultaneously supported the “Signatura doctrinae”—the signature doctrine. According to this belief, God designated his own sign on the healing substances, which indicated their application for certain diseases. For example, the haselwort is reminiscent of the liver; thus, it must be beneficial for liver diseases; St John's wort\nHypericum perforatum\nL. would be beneficial for treatment of wounds and stings given that the plant leaves appear as if they had been stung.\nWhile the old peoples used medicinal plants primarily as simple pharmaceutical forms—infusions, decoctions and macerations—in the Middle Ages, and in particular between 16th and 18th centuries, the demand for compound drugs was increasing. The compound drugs comprised medicinal plants along with drugs of animal and plant origin. If the drug the theriac was produced from a number of medicinal plants, rare animals, and minerals, it was highly valued and sold expensively.[\nIn 18th century, in his work\nSpecies Plantarium\n(1753), Linnaeus (1707-1788) provided a brief description and classification of the species described until then. The species were described and named without taking into consideration whether some of them had previously been described somewhere. For the naming, a polynomial system was employed where the first word denoted the genus while the remaining polynomial phrase explained other features of the plant (e.g. the willow Clusius was named\nSalix pumila angustifolia antera\n). Linnaeus altered the naming system into a binominal one. The name of each species consisted of the genus name, with an initial capital letter, and the species name, with an initial small letter.[\nEarly 19th century was a turning point in the knowledge and use of medicinal plants. The discovery, substantiation, and isolation of alkaloids from poppy (1806), ipecacuanha (1817), strychnos (1817), quinine (1820), pomegranate (1878), and other plants, then the isolation of glycosides, marked the beginning of scientific pharmacy. With the upgrading of the chemical methods, other active substances from medicinal plants were also discovered such as tannins, saponosides, etheric oils, vitamins, hormones, etc.[\nIn late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a great danger of elimination of medicinal plants from therapy. Many authors wrote that drugs obtained from them had many shortcomings due to the destructive action of enzymes, which cause fundamental changes during the process of medicinal plants drying, i.e. medicinal plants’ healing action depends on the mode of drying. In 19th century, therapeutics, alkaloids, and glycosides isolated in pure form were increasingly supplanting the drugs from which they had been isolated. Nevertheless, it was soon ascertained that although the action of pure alkaloids was faster, the action of alkaloid drugs was full and long-lasting. In early 20th century, stabilization methods for fresh medicinal plants were proposed, especially the ones with labile medicinal components. Besides, much effort was invested in study of the conditions of manufacturing and cultivation of medicinal plants.[\nOn account of chemical, physiological, and clinical studies, numerous forgotten plants and drugs obtained thereof were restored to pharmacy:\nAconitum, Punica granatum, Hyosciamus, Stramonium, Secale cornutum, Filix mas, Opium, Styrax, Colchicum, Ricinus\n, and so forth. The active components of medicinal plants are a product of the natural, most seamless laboratory. The human organism accepts the drug obtained from them best in view of the fact that man is an integral part of nature.[\n] There are scores of examples of this kind; perhaps they will instigate serious research into the old manuscripts on medicinal plants, which would not be observed out of curiosity about history but as potential sources of contemporary pharmacotherapy.\nIn present days, almost all pharmacopoeias in the world—Ph Eur 6,[\n] USP XXXI,[\n] BP 2007[\n]—proscribe plant drugs of real medicinal value. There are countries (the United Kingdom,[\n] Russia, Germany[\n]) that have separate herbal pharmacopoeias. Yet, in practice, a much higher number of unofficial drugs are always used. Their application is grounded on the experiences of popular medicine (traditional or popular medicine) or on the new scientific research and experimental results (conventional medicine). Many medicinal plants are applied through self-medication or at the recommendation of a physician or pharmacist. They are used independently or in combination with synthetic drugs (complementary medicine). For the sake of adequate and successfully applied therapy, knowledge of the precise diagnosis of the illness as well as of medicinal plants, i.e. the pharmacological effect of their components is essential. Plant drugs and phytopreparations, most commonly with defined active components, verified action and, sometimes, therapeutic efficiency, are applied as therapeutic means. In the major European producer and consumer of herbal preparations—Germany, rational phytotherapy is employed, based on applications of preparations whose efficiency depends on the applied dose and identified active components, and their efficiency has been corroborated by experimental and clinical tests. Those preparations have been manufactured from standardized plant drug extracts, and they adhere to all requirements for pharmaceutical quality of drugs.\nWith the new Law on Drugs and Medical Devices dated September 2007[\n] and enacted in the Republic of Macedonia, dry or sometimes fresh parts of medicinal plants (herbal substances) may be used for preparation of herbal drugs, herbal processed products, and traditional herbal drugs. Herbal substances may also be utilized for manufacture of homeopathic drugs, which are stipulated in the current law, too. In the Republic of Macedonia herbal preparations are dispensed without a medical prescription, as “over the counter” (OTC) preparations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSince time immemorial people have tried to find medications to alleviate pain and cure different illnesses. In every period, every successive century from the development of humankind and advanced civilizations, the healing properties of certain medicinal plants were identified, noted, and conveyed to the successive generations. The benefits of one society were passed on to another, which upgraded the old properties, discovered new ones, till present days. The continuous and perpetual people's interest in medicinal plants has brought about today's modern and sophisticated fashion of their processing and usage.\nFootnotes\nSource of Support:\nNil\nConflict of Interest:\nNone declared\nREFERENCES\nStojanoski N.

    "content": "Ayurvedic herbs and spices play an important part in a holistic approach to health and wellness. Ayurveda is a traditional medicine system from India that focuses on promoting wellness of body, mind, and spirit. The holistic approach combines lifestyle changes, diet, and exercise.\nAyurvedic herbs and spices play an important role in the overall system of\nAyurvedic medicine\n. Followers of Ayurveda state that the medications offer protection from disease, help with\nmental health\n, and aid digestion.\nThis article explores some Ayurvedic herbs and spices that help make up the system and the research behind their health benefits.\nThe herbs and spices have some scientific backing for their purported benefits, but a person should still talk with a doctor before making any significant changes to their diet.\nWhat is Ayurveda?\nShare on Pinterest\nZHPH Production/Stocksy\nAyurveda is a traditional, holistic approach to medicine that originated in India. The system promotes mental, physical, and spiritual wellness through exercise, diet, and other lifestyle changes.\nPeople who practice Ayurveda report that the traditional approach to medicine has several proven benefits. Results from an older\n2014\nstudy proposed that researchers should do more to incorporate the knowledge from Ayurveda with clinically proven, modern medicines.\nCertain herbs and spices play a major role in Ayurveda. The nonprofit Art of Living organization claims they\ncan provide\nbenefits such as:\nimproving vitality\npurifying and detoxifying the body and blood\nboosting mental health\nimproving digestion\naiding weight loss\nimproving skin tone\nhelping to reduce the side effects of\ncancer\nPeople may use Ayurvedic herbs internally or externally, depending on the specific herb and its intended purpose.\nAyurvedic herbs\nThe following Ayurvedic herbs and spices have some supporting evidence that suggests they may help with certain aspects of a person’s health.\nCumin\nCumin has a smoky, earthy flavor. People often use this spice in Indian recipes and recipes from the Southwestern United States.\nSome\nevidence suggests\nthat cumin shows significant antioxidant activities in some test procedures.\nThe effect cumin has on\nfree radicals\nis suggested as the underlying reason for many of its pharmacological effects, which are:\nantimicrobial\nanticarcinogenic\nantimutagenic\nantidiabetic\ndiuretic\nimmunomodulatory (changes the body’s immune system)\nestrogenic and anti-osteoporotic\ngastrointestinal\nManjistha\nManjistha is also known as\nRubia cordifolia\nor common madder. This plant\nmay help\nto positively alter the gut microbiome. However, to feel these effects, a person may need to take it in higher concentrations than those typically available through manjistha. For this reason, someone may wish to take a manjistha supplement or as part of a gut healing regimen.\nAdditionally, a\n2020 study\nof a compound extracted from the\nR. cordifolia\nroot suggests a possible phytomedicine in treating bone diseases.\nBoswellia\nAlso known as olibanum or Indian frankincense,\nBoswellia\nhas a woody, spicy aroma when people cook with it.\nSeveral studies suggest it may have positive health benefits:\n2016 study\nshowed\nBoswellia\nmay help with reducing pain and swelling associated with osteoarthritis.\nAnother\n2016 study\nshowed that the herb may help prevent the growth of leukemia tumors.\nAccording to a\n2018 study\n, an herbal composition containing\nBoswellia\nhelped improve\nasthma\nsymptoms.\nLicorice root\nLicorice root\nmay have\nanti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, making it helpful in fighting infections when people use it regularly. It also has other uses, such as in\ndental treatment\nand\nneuroprotective pharmacology\nAshwagandha\nAshwagandha is a woody plant native to India and northern Africa. People have used it in Ayurvedic remedies for at least\n3,000 years\nSome evidence suggests that ashwagandha can help with\nstress\nand anxiety. An older study from\n2012\nshowed that high concentrations of ashwagandha root extract positively reduced stress and improved quality of life.\nA study from\n2016\nfound that taking an ashwagandha supplement may help improve muscle strength. The researchers recommended using ashwagandha in conjunction with a resistance training program.\nAccording to a\n2018 placebo-controlled clinical trial\n, evidence suggests ashwagandha may benefit those with hypothyroidism.\nFinally, a more recent\n2021 systematic review\nof ashwagandha and its pharmacological use noted scientific evidence to support its effects on health and healing.\nBrahmi\nPeople often use brahmi, or\nBacopa monnieri\n, when making Ayurvedic medications.\nSome\nevidence suggests\nbrahmi may help with improving concentration, cognitive ability, and attention, with a\n2019 study\ninvestigating its efficacy in treating Alzheimer’s disease.\nAjwain\nAjwain grows in several countries around the world, including India and Iran. Though it may help with several areas of health, a\n2019 trial\nfound ajwain to have the ability to reduce blood sugar levels, meaning it could help people living with diabetes.\nAccording to an older\n2014\nstudy, the benefits and uses of ajwain over the years have included helping with:\nbloating\nloss of appetite\nfatigue\nabdominal pain\nabdominal tumors\ndiarrhea\nrespiratory distress\nIn addition, the herb may have the following effects:\nantifungal\nantibacterial\nantioxidant\nhypolipidemic\nantiparasitic\nTurmeric\nTurmeric has a distinctive yellow color and people often use it in curry recipes.\nSome\nevidence suggests\nturmeric may have an anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effect. This may make it helpful for certain inflammatory conditions, such as some forms of arthritis.\nAdditionally,\nearly evidence\nsuggests that turmeric may exhibit skin health benefits when taken orally or applied topically. However, further scientific evidence is crucial to support this claim.\nNeem\nNeem is an herb that\nmay have\nantioxidant effects and help with several of the body’s functions.\nStudies have indicated neem may also help with preventing or treating cancer. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects.\nCardamom\nCardamom is another herb used in Ayurvedic medicine dating back thousands of years.\nSome evidence suggests that using cardamom as an essential oil may\nhelp improve\nair intake during exercise and\nreduce\nblood pressure.\nBitter melon\nBitter melon is a type of tropical vine related to squash and zucchini.\nSome\nresearch suggests\nbitter melon has a positive effect on the secretion of\ninsulin\nand the control of blood sugar.\nPeople who take insulin and would like to add this herb to their diet should discuss this with their doctor to prevent any concerning dip in their blood sugar levels.\nGotu kola\nGotu kola adds no aroma or flavor to food, but studies indicate that it may help improve memory.\nAccording to a\n2016 study\n, researchers found that 750–1,000 milligrams (mg) of gotu kola is more effective than folic acid in improving the memory of people who have had a\nstroke\nTriphala\nTriphala consists of three small fruits: amla, bibhitaki, and haritaki.\nEvidence suggests\ntriphala has anti-inflammatory effects, which could make it effective in treating arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.\nHowever, doctors and healthcare professionals often use triphala for digestive conditions, where it has several\nclinical uses\n, including as a laxative, an appetite stimulant, and an antioxidant.\nPrecautions\nBefore starting any new diet or rubbing an herb or spice on their skin, a person should consider talking with their doctor.\nSome\nexperts warn\nthat certain Ayurvedic medicine preparations can contain toxic levels of arsenic, mercury, or lead.\nPeople should talk with a doctor before using any herbal or spice mixtures if they:\ntake medications\nare living with a chronic health condition\nare pregnant or nursing\nSummary\nAyurvedic herbs and spices may provide some health benefits.\nHowever, a person should use caution and talk with their doctor when considering whether to use them as supplements or lotions.\nA person may tolerate adding herbs and spices to their food, but there is limited evidence about the amount necessary to have a positive impact on health."

The economic and societal burden of migraine is substantial, affecting patients’ quality of life in terms of work, social activities, and family life. This article attempts to review the available literature for clinical evidence of Ayurveda in the management of migraines. We performed a literature search from January 2000 to July 2020 on popular search engines such as Pub Med, Google Scholar, and AYUSH Research Portal using the keywords “Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Migraine”, “Ayurveda and Migraine” and “Panchakarma and Migraine”. The selection criteria involved published clinical trials, including pilot studies, whereas review articles, concept papers, letters to the editor, and studies published in languages other than English were excluded. Out of 77 studies that were screened, 12 articles that satisfied the selection criteria consisted of six Randomized controlled Trials (RCTs), five non-RCTs, and one pilot study. Among them, ten studies used polyherbal and Herbo mineral formulations, two studies contained no oral medications, three trials utilized external therapies, and ten studies used panchakarma procedures. Eleven studies found Ayurveda to be clinically beneficial as monotherapy, while one study demonstrated the usefulness of Ayurveda as an add-on to conventional management. This review reveals the beneficial role of Ayurveda in the management of migraines without many side effects. Yet several limitations exist, like small sample size, short follow up, and lack of better outcome measures for pre and post-assessments. Future research should overcome these limitations and follow a robust methodology so that definitive conclusions can be drawn.\nKeywords:\nArdhavabhedaka, Ayurveda, migraine, Nasya, shirashoola, virechana\nBackground\nMigraine being a primary headache, affects one in seven globally.[\n] Characterized by a unilateral, pulsatile, throbbing sensation, it limits day-to-day activities of daily living. Ranked third most prevalent and seventh highest specific cause of disability worldwide (GBD 2012),[\n] migraine is currently the leading cause of Years Lived with Disability/Disease (YLD) among individuals under 50 years with a male, female ratio of 1:3.[\n] Migraine therapy involves the use of non-specific and specific drugs, and more recently, “gepants” are used for prevention and acute management.[\n] Though these conventional treatments have proved to be satisfactory, they are associated with side effects. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies are increasingly being sought after by migraineurs worldwide for prophylaxis and treatment of attacks. Acupuncture, yoga, meditation, Ayurveda, biofeedback, cognitive behavior therapy, massage therapy, and Nutraceuticals are some of the popular methods.[\n] A cross-sectional study shows among 685 patients with headaches, 478 of them were using CAM, out of which 44.4% were suffering from migraine.[\n] In another national cross-sectional survey, adults with migraine/severe headaches used CAM more often as compared to those without, i.e., 49.5% vs. 33.9%.[\n] In India, Ayurveda medicines are widely used for the cure and management of various disorders, including migraines. Despite being widely practiced, there are no well-documented studies evaluating their safety and efficacy. Hence, in the present paper, an attempt has been made to review and analyse the available literature on various Ayurveda approaches in migraines. The review accentuates the role and scope of evidence-based Ayurveda measures as a stand-alone or as added to the existing conventional measures in migraine.\nMigraine in Ayurveda\nMigraine can be correlated to “Ardhavabhedaka” in Ayurveda. Detailed description of specific etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment for Ardhavabhedaka is explained in treatises. Etiological factors such as excessive consumption of dry/ununctuous substances, exposure to cold, inappropriate sexual activity, withholding of natural urges, exhaustion, and exercise are quoted as the causes for Vata (biological humour ~ neurological function) vitiation. Frequent intake of food before the digestion of a previous meal, intake of heavy to digest food, drinking excess cold water contribute to Kapha (biological humour ~ systemic integrity) vitiation and formation of ama (a by-product of impaired metabolism). Due to the above etiological factors, Vata alone or along with Kapha affects the head and produces severe unilateral pain in the neck, eyebrow, temples, ear, eye, and forehead. Pain is acute, similar to a blow from sharp weapons, pricking, or splitting, and when severe, it impairs the functions of the eye and ear.[\n] Pain is paroxysmal, occurring once in ten days, twelve days, or daily.[\n] This phenomenon can be closely read in line with the series of events such as vasodilatation, secondary extravasation, edema, mast cell degranulation, and cortical spreading depression that is triggered by the release of neuropeptides from the trigeminal innervation in migraine. The treatment includes Snehapana (internal Oleation), Svedana (sudation), Virechana (Therapeutic Purgation), and Nasya (Nasal Instillations), followed by oral intake of Polyherbal and Herbo-mineral medications. Further symptoms of migraine often correlate with those of ‘Amlapitta’ (state of hyperacidity) characterized by giddiness, fainting, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Hence, therapies that aid in hyperacidity and correction of digestive fire also aid in improving migraine symptoms.[\nMaterials & Methods\nA thorough literature search was conducted in three electronic databases (PubMed, AYUSH Research Portal, and Google Scholar) from January 2000 to July 2020. Clinical trials, pilot studies, and case reports published in the English language were included. Preclinical studies, conceptual reviews, and unpublished manuscripts were excluded. The keywords used in PubMed were “Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Migraine”, “Ayurveda and Migraine”, “Panchakarma and Migraine”. Sixty-two articles were obtained, out of which one pilot study and three clinical trials were shortlisted. The filters used in AYUSH Research Portal were (a) Medical system: Ayurveda, (b) Category: Clinical research, followed by (c) Body system: Neurological, and (d) Disease: Migraine, yielding seventeen articles graded A, B, and C, based on the WHO recommendations. Under Grade A, there were no articles, Grade B had five papers, and Grade C had twelve articles. Two of these studies were found in PubMed. After screening through the title, abstract, and year of publication, eight articles were found to meet our criteria. Finally, twelve eligible articles were shortlisted, i.e., eleven clinical trials and one pilot study. The details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the articles shortlisted from various sources are depicted in the PRISMA flow chart [\nFigure 1\n]. The details of the studies included in this review are summarized in a table [\nTable 1\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nPRISMA flow diagram\nTable 1.\nClinical trials involving ayurveda intervention in migraine\nAuthor (year)\nStudy design and sample size\nMedicine dosage and duration\nOutcome measures\nResults\nDr.MS Vasudha, NK Manjunath, HR Nagendra (2018)\nClinical Trial\n=30 Ayurveda and Yoga (AY)\n=30 (Control group)\nVirechana comprising -\n1) Deepana - with Hinguvachadi churnam-2.5 to 5g Duration: 3 days\n2) Snehapana with Kalyanaka ghrta (30 ml-150 ml), duration - 3 to 5 days.\n3) Abhyanga and sveda\n4) Virechana with Trivrt lehyam Oral Medication -\n5) Pathyaksha dhatryadi Kashaya -15 ml bd for 75 days.\n6) Thalam with Kachooradi churna and milk\n7) Yoga\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 10)\nSignificant reduction in MIDAS, PSS, and improved sympatho-vagal balance were observed in the AY group.

Eight studies used polyherbal formulations, four used Herbo-mineral formulations, and one study had a combination of both. Ten trials had employed panchakarma procedures; among them, eight studies included Nasya in the treatment protocol, and three trials included Virechana. Two studies were devoid of oral therapy, wherein Nasya alone or along with external therapies were administered. Eleven studies found Ayurveda to be clinically beneficial as monotherapy, while one study demonstrated the usefulness of Ayurveda as an add-on to conventional management. Among these, two studies incorporated an integrated approach of Ayurveda and yoga to give statistically significant results.[\n] One clinical trial has included Behavioral Toxicity and Neurological Side effect as assessed by DOTES (Dose recorded and treatment-emergent symptom scale) criteria and found minimal side effects.[\n] No side effects or adverse events were reported in any other studies.\nDiscussion\nThe use of CAM in migraines is a growing phenomenon that is poorly understood. Currently, among the CAM treatment approaches to migraine, the evidence is mainly available for yoga, Tai, and acupuncture.[\n] Ayurveda has a holistic approach, which comprehensively promotes mind-body medicine. Furthermore, Ayurveda therapies are known to influence physiological processes, including autonomic modulation and metabolic profiles.[\nShodhana (purification) and Shamana (pacifying) therapy are two limbs of Ayurveda treatment. Migraine being correlated to Ardhavabhedaka, Shodhana procedures Nasya and Virechana, and Shamana medicines in the form of medicated ghee and polyherbal decoctions have been vividly prescribed as effective interventions in the classics.[\n] Most of the studies have employed Virechana along with Nasya and Shamana medicines for better efficacy in terms of severity, frequency, and duration of the headache. In line with classical management, few trials have employed Virechana before Nasya and pacifying medicines; there was no common formulation of choice across them. But all the medications were targeted against involved dosha (Humour). Hence, discussed mainly focuses on the interventions like Nasya, Virechana, and Shamana medicines comprising different Herbal and Herbo-mineral preparations and External therapy.\nNasya\nNasya is one of Bio-purificatory measures; the procedure involves the administration of medicines through the nasal route. Medicines administered through the nasal route directly deliver the medicine to the brain, thereby disseminating it to the entire body.[\n] On administration, the potency of the herbs used for nasal instillation reach\nshringataka\n(the vital point at the base of the nose), and then the potency spreads to the head, eyes, ear, and throat, and aids in expelling the morbid\ndoshas (vitiated humour)\nfrom the head. The probable mode of action may be imputed to its stimulating effect on the brain through olfactory and respiratory pathways. The nasal epithelium is a highly permeable monolayer, and the submucosa also has extensive vasculature; it promotes rapid absorption and direct entry of the drug into the systemic circulation, bypassing hepatic metabolism. Intranasal drug delivery via olfactory and respiratory pathways is a promising option to deliver medication to the central nervous system. Lipid-based drugs of lower molecular weight less than 400–600 Da (Dalton), with a positive charge, have a better capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier.[\nThere are eight studies on Nasya. Two studies are on Brhat Dashamoola taila, wherein it was compared with Laghu Sutashekhara rasa (LSR), go-ghrta, and placebo. Four sittings of Nasya for one week with a gap of one week were administered. Although significant improvement was found in severity and frequency of headache, the LSR group fared better than the other three groups.[\n] In another study, LSR alone was more efficacious than LSR and three sittings of Brhat Dashamoola taila nasya with a gap of one week in reducing the severity, frequency, and duration of headaches as well as associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and aura.[\n] In a study on Gunja taila shodhana nasya (eliminating nasal instillation), Nasya was administered after following pre and post-therapeutic measures as per treatise. Significant improvements with delayed response were noticed in the frequency of headache, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, and anorexia. But when administered with Pathyadi Ghana Vati, the clinical response was faster and more beneficial.[\n] A study on Kumkumadi Ghrita was significant in ameliorating symptoms related to migraine headache compared to Dashamoolashrtaksheera Shirodhara (dipping of milk boiled medicated herbs on forehead). Yet the therapies Nasya and Shirodhara, in combination, had greater potential in the management of the same.[\nIn another study, Brhat Jeevakadi taila nasya showed better results in symptoms associated with migraine headache, including severity and frequency, compared to Flunarizine 10 mg, wherein it fared better only in reducing the associated vomiting.[\n] In another study, Panchagavya Ghrta nasya along with Tab. Flunarizine 10 mg scored better on pain scales. A lower proportion of patients had Behavioural Toxicity and Neurological Side effects as compared to the Flunarizine-placebo and Flunarizine-only groups.[\n] A study on Shatahvadi taila showed significant improvement in migraine severity, frequency, and duration of attack.[\n] Anutaila nasya, every alternate day for fourteen days, showed good relief in 70% of cases in comparison to 60% of subjects with Kaphaketu rasa. Better results were obtained when both medicines were combined, and poor results were observed in 10% of subjects that received Anutaila nasya.[\nVirechana\nVirechana is one of the Bio-purificatory measures. Virechana drains the cellular fluid into the interstitial fluid. Later, the fluid moves into the vascular compartment, which is further drained into the Gastrointestinal tract for expulsion. Thus, the process creates a biochemical alteration as it modulates the fluid compartments of the body. The fluid which gets drained out contains dissolved biochemicals.[\n] Oral medications administered after bio-purificatory measures exert better efficacy owing to improved metabolic status. The procedure includes measures that augment digestive fire followed by oral intake of medicated fats, therapeutic massage, sudation, and finally induced purgation. In the present review, Virechana was carried out in three studies. Vasudha MS\net al\n. administered Trivrt Lehya for virechana, while Shweta Mata\net al\n] chose Triphala churna for mridu (mild) virechana for three days.\nShamanaoushadhi (pacifying medications)\nPathyadi Khada (Polyherbal decoction) is commonly prescribed for migraine.[\n] It was effective in two controlled clinical trials and one pilot study.[\n] In an RCT, Pathyadi Khada was administered in the form of a tablet, i.e., Pathyadi Ghanavati[\n] was effective in improving the severity, frequency, and duration of headaches measured on MIDAS and CHQQ (Comprehensive-Headache Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire). Further, sympathovagal balance and reduced frontalis muscle activity were recorded with its use in combination with yoga. The ingredients of Pathyadi Khada possess anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory properties, and are neuroprotective.[\n] Additionally, Pathya (Terminalia chebula Retz.) has analgesic properties.[\n] Mashadi kashaya and Nimbadi Guggulu were administered in a single group of migraineurs along with Shatahvadi taila nasya. The overall assessment showed complete relief in eighteen patients and marked relief in twelve patients.[\nHerbo-mineral medications\nFive clinical trials utilized Herbo-mineral preparations in their study. Ayurveda Treatment Protocol (AyTP) consisting of a combination of Narikela Lavana 2000 mg, Sootashekhara Rasa 375 mg, Sitopaladi Churna 1425 mg, Rasona Vati 3000 mg, and Godanti Mishran 500 mg at a dose of 7.3 g per day was administered in a large sample of 406 subjects.[\n] The combination of the AyTP safety profile of Sootashekhara Rasa, Rasona Vati, and Godanti Mishran was initially established in animal models.[\n] Seventy-two (35.2%) of the patients got completely cured, and no improvement was seen in seven (3.4%) patients. Forty-five (11%) patients discontinued the therapy due to deterioration of the condition. But there were no noticeable adverse events in the patients who completed 90 days of treatment. In another study, Sutashekhara Rasa with drakshajala (raisins-soaked water) as an adjunct was administered along with Brhat Jeevakadi taila nasya. Compared to Flunarizine, Sutashekhara Rasa, along with Nasya ameliorated most symptoms associated with migraine.[\n] Laghu Sutashekhara rasa (LSR) was administered in two studies as stand-alone and in combination with nasya.[\n] LSR as a stand-alone was found to be more effective compared to Nasya. Similarly, Kaphaketu rasa as stand-alone and along with Anutaila Nasya showed significant results.[\nExternal therapy\nAgnikarma (cautery)[\n] with Panchadhatu Shalaka (an instrument for cautery made of five metals) was carried out in a pilot study for four settings with a gap of one week, and Pathyadi Khada was administered internally. Significant improvements were seen in eleven (78.6%) patients. Studies claim probable stimulation of lateral spinothalamic tract due to heat which intern stimulates the descending pain inhibitory fibres. This, in turn, inhibits the release of Psubstance (Presynaptic inhibition) and blocks the transmission of pain sensation. Heat has also been thought to act as a counter-irritant. According to the pain-gate control theory, heat stimulates the nociceptor fibres residing in the superficial skin. These fast-acting fibres, after being stimulated, close the gate for slow-acting fibres for chronic pain.[\n] Shirodhara (dipping therapy) with Dashmoolashrita Ksheera over the forehead for 45 min/day for 21 days exerted soothing effects but was not effective compared to Kumkumadi Ghrita Nasya. But studies have shown the efficacy of Shirodhara in chronic daily headaches.[\n] Kachooradi churna application over the forehead along with purificatory and pacifying medications was effective in migraine.[\nAssessment tools\nMost of the studies employed a subjective parameter scale for the assessment of the outcome. The items of assessment include severity, frequency, and duration of headache, associated symptoms like photophobia, phonophobia, aura, nausea, and vomiting. Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire was utilized for assessment in three studies.[\n] Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for measurement of the intensity of the pain was employed in three studies.[\n] Headache Impact Test-6 and Perceived Stress Scale-10 were utilized in two studies.[\n] Clinical Global Impression rating scale to assess severity, as well as improvement after therapy (CGI, CGI-I), Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), were used in one study. Behavioral Toxicity and Neurological Side effects using DOTES criteria as well as presenting the patient-reported side effects or symptoms associated with migraine during the therapy were administered in one study.[\n] One study appreciably incorporated Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and surface Electromyography (sEMG). In this study, ten patients with migraine with aura (MA) had reduced SDNN, as well as an increased LF/HF ratio, suggesting sympathetic hyperactivity. The migraine without aura (MO) patients (\n= 17) had a similar impairment, though not as severe as in the MA group.[\n] The study outcome confirms an attenuated stress response after Ayurveda and Yoga integrated approach.[\nLimitations\nRandomization was the major limitation; even though the studies were systematically conducted and showed significant results, there was a lack of randomization. Out of twelve studies reviewed, only six studies were Randomized Control Trials. None of the studies were double-blinded, whereas few were rater blinded studies. Only one study had placebo and active control (flunarizine) in comparison to Ayurveda intervention. Most of the studies were underpowered with a small sample size to answer the research question of interest. In the Study by Trivedi M\net al.\n, though the sample size was good, uniformity across the group was not maintained. A study by Vaidya PB\net al\n. included a large sample size of 406, but it was a single group observational study. Though the study was the only multi-centric study, the study lacked a control group, scales for assessment of tolerability and toxicity of Herbo-mineral medications were not included. Further, no proper response was stated for the dropout of 45 (11.0%) patients from the study. The sample size justification was available in only two studies conducted by Vasudha MS\net al\n] Another major limitation of the studies was employing subjective grading of the symptoms for the assessment of the outcome. Though few studies showed significant results, the assessment scales were subjective. In the studies on Nasya, only one study had employed the pre and post-measures of Nasya therapy as per classical treatises. Apart from one study, no other studies had employed tests to assess toxicity, neurological Side effects, and patient-reported side effects or symptoms of migraine.\nScope for Further Research\nAdopting the line of treatment of Ardhavabhedaka (migraine) as per classical treatises and use of Herbo, Herbo-mineral, and various ghee-based preparations for purificatory measures and pacifying the condition in the form of RCTs with adequate sample size. Adopting standardized assessment outcome measures with the assessment of safety of the intervention and drug interactions. Incorporating advanced techniques like Blood Oxygen Level Dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI), functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), Heart Rate Variability (HRV) would aid understanding the pathophysiology, neurobiology of the intervention and would help in generating solid evidence for Ayurveda interventions.\nConclusion\nAyurveda has a holistic approach to treatment rather than symptom-specific management, be it a migraine or any other disease. Intervention from the level of etiology, pathogenesis, aggravating and relieving factors, and disease-specific management along with diet and lifestyle is vital in Ayurveda. Bio-purificatory measures like Virechana and Nasya have shown good efficacy as standialone and as an add-on with oral herbal and Herbo-mineral preparations. Though few studies have shown significant results, they are underpowered due to the small sample size, lack of control group, and randomization. Future research should target to understand the pathophysiology of migraine and the changes Ayurvedic therapies could bring in, with adequate sample size, use of validated scales, biomarkers, neuroimaging, and autonomic function tests for better understanding of the neurobiology of Ayurveda intervention.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nWe acknowledge the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), the Department of AYUSH, Government of India for funding the study.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\nGormley P, Anttila V, Winsvold BS, Palta P, Esko T, Pers TH, et al.

In addition to these established medications, herbal ingredients have been used over centuries to help treat common cold symptoms. The Ayurveda and Jamu systems of medicine, originating from India and Indonesia, respectively, have leveraged herbal therapies to treat many illnesses.\nMethod\nAn expert roundtable discussion comprising specialists in Ayurveda, Jamu, pharmacology and surgery along with a literature review was conducted to evaluate the use of four herbs – ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint – for common cold symptom management in Ayurvedic texts, Jamu publications and monographs from the World Health Organization, Health Canada and various European guidelines.\nDiscussion\nDue to a lack of antivirals, common cold management revolves around maintaining personal hygiene and symptom management. Herbal medicines have been an integral part of many cultures worldwide. Despite its growing acceptance, there is a perception that healthcare providers lack interest and may prevent patients from discussing the use of herbal medicines. Limited education and training may also widen the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers, hindering effective management.\nConclusion\nEvaluation of scientific evidence and the standing in international monographs can offer perspectives on the use of herbal medicines for common cold management.\nKeywords:\ncomplementary therapies, COVID-19, ginger, integrative medicine, liquorice, peppermint, turmeric, upper respiratory tract infections\nIntroduction\nThe common cold is a syndrome of upper respiratory symptoms caused by various viruses.\nSymptoms of the common cold include sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough, sore throat and malaise.\nThese symptoms typically last up to 1 week, with their severity peaking around the second to third day of infection.\nThe common cold imposes a substantial disease and economic burden stemming from its high frequency, with an estimate of about six episodes per year in children under 2 years of age, and two to three episodes per year in adults, as well as from its impact on quality of life.\nIn terms of economic impact, the common cold causes an estimated yearly loss of US$40 billion directly through treatment costs and indirectly via loss of productivity.\nThe common cold is generally mild and self-limiting.\nSymptoms of the common cold are so well known that self-diagnosis is normal amongst individuals.\nHowever, there are misuses of diagnosis testing and overuse of treatment prescriptions for suspected bacterial acute rhinosinusitis, which occurs at a very low incidence of less than 2% of all common colds.\nIt is also important to be aware of the distinction between bacterial and non-bacterial acute rhinosinusitis, as incorrect antibiotic use may result in more harm than benefit and the potential risk of developing resistance.\nManagement of the common cold\nDue to lack of antiviral treatments targeting specific common cold viruses, prevention and treatment of the common cold typically revolves around maintaining personal hygiene and symptom management.\nFurthermore, as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks, physical distancing, travel restrictions and avoiding crowds may limit the spread of infectious diseases like influenza.\nPatients typically manage a common cold through self-care, using a range of over-the-counter therapies like antihistamines, antitussives, decongestants and antipyretics.\nNasal irrigation is also recommended by the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) 2020 to relieve symptoms of the common cold.\nTreatments and practices that are used concurrently with or in place of the conventional, mainstream medicine – broadly termed complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) – are gaining widespread popularity and acceptance worldwide.\nAmongst CAM, the use of herbal medicines has been an integral part of many cultures worldwide.\nIt is estimated that up to four billion people rely primarily on herbal medicinal products for healthcare and medical practice.\nIn addition, EPOS 2020 recommends the use of herbal medicines for the common cold because of their efficacy in controlling symptoms without the risk of major adverse events.\nDespite its growing usage and acceptance, there is a perception that healthcare providers lack interest in CAM,\nwhich may prevent patients from exploring this option with their healthcare providers.\nLimited education and training on CAM may also widen the communication gap between patients and their healthcare providers, hindering effective patient management.\nTo overcome this barrier, physicians have acknowledged the need for a better understanding of CAM and its synergistic implementation into routine practice.\nThis review aims to provide a better understanding of the traditional and modern perspectives on some of the herbal ingredients putatively used for common cold symptom management. In particular, we will discuss in this regard the principles of two traditional systems of medicine: Ayurveda and Jamu. As herbal ingredients form the core component of these systems, we evaluate four herbs used in the treatment of common cold symptoms: ginger (\nZingiber officinale\n), liquorice (\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\n), turmeric (\nCurcuma longa\n) and peppermint (\nMenthae piperitae\n). Specifically, we will evaluate the evidence and their standing in local and international monographs for the management of the common cold and offer an overview on the future of herbal medicines in its treatment.\nMethods\nThis review was developed following an expert virtual roundtable meeting comprising five specialists in Ayurveda, Jamu, pharmacology and surgery conducted in November 2021. Literature searches were conducted using search terms including “ginger”, “licorice”, “liquorice”, “turmeric”, “peppermint”, “Ayurveda” and “Jamu”. Only results relevant to the topic of the common cold were selected. Additional references focusing specifically on Ayurvedic texts, publications on Jamu, and monographs from World Health Organization (WHO), Health Canada and various European guidelines were also selected.\nReview\nAyurveda and Jamu\nIntroduction to Ayurveda and Jamu\nAyurveda is a renowned traditional medical system originating from India.\nIt aims to provide a holistic approach to health and personalized medicine as it comprises the physical, psychological, philosophical, ethical and spiritual components of health.\nHerbal ingredients are featured prominently in Ayurveda, and approximately 90% of Ayurvedic preparations are plant based.\nIndonesia holds the second largest biodiversity in the world after the Amazon rainforests.\nIndeed, of the medicinal plant species in Southeast Asia, nearly 80% can be found in Indonesia.\nWith this rich source of medicinal plants, people from Indonesia widely use a traditional herbal medicine system called Jamu.\nDespite the increasing importance of modern conventional medicine, Jamu remains widely used across rural and urban areas of Indonesia by an estimated two-fifths of the population.\nAyurveda principles for the common cold\nThe basic principles of Ayurveda lie in the belief that the entire universe is composed of five elements: Prithvi (Earth), Jala (Water), Teja (Fire), Vayu (Air) and Aakash (Space or ether).\nThese five elements, referred to as Pancha Mahabhoota, are believed to form the three fundamental humours (tridoshas) of the human body in varying combinations.\nThese three humours are Vata dosha, Pitta dosha and Kapha dosha, which control the fundamental functions of the body.\nVata dosha regulates electrolyte balance, cellular transport and elimination of waste products.\nPitta dosha regulates thermogenesis, optic nerve coordination, and satiety and thirst.\nLastly, Kapha dosha provides lubrication to the joints.\nAs the strength of each dosha is affected by conditions of the body and food consumed, Ayurveda is based on the belief that balance between the three doshas and other elements of nature is necessary to maintain a healthy body.\nThe manifestation of a communicable viral infection can happen due to unstable air (Vayu), water (Jala), soil (Desha) and season (Kala) elements.\nThe initial stages of a viral infection, such as an upper respiratory tract infection like the common cold, starts off as an exogenous disease (Agantu Roga), which later progresses into a system disease (Nija Roga).\nIt can arise due to slow digestion (Mandagni) and lead to the production of toxins (Ama) in the body. As the bodily Ama accumulates, it blocks the channels of the body\nand eventually enters the deep tissues to clog the cell membranes, inhibits cellular communication and weakens the immune response.\nThe resulting disruption of the body doshas is described in Ayurvedic texts as the pathogenesis of salient common cold symptoms. For instance, the manifestation of cough (Kāsa) is explained by the obstruction of the Vata dosha afflicting the upward movement of air (Vayu), leading to a build-up in the head and neck region.\nThe contraction of the thorax and eyes is followed by a forced expulsion of air, giving rise to cough, which can be either dry or productive.\nRhinitis (Pratishyaya) is regarded in Ayurveda as one of the most important nasal diseases (Nasa Roga) as it is assumed to be the causative factor for other nasal diseases.\nAyurveda describes rhinitis as a condition where impairment of Vata dosha and Kapha dosha at the root of the nose produces secretions that flow down through the nose.\nThe treatment process in Ayurveda employs the Pancha Karma method,\nwhich comprises five actions or karmas that are used to remove toxins from body tissue.\nThe five karmas are Vaman (forced emesis), Virechan (purgation using powders, pastes or decoctions), Basti (enemas prepared from medicated oils), Nasya (nasal administration of medicines such as decoctions, oils and fumes) and Rakta moksha (blood detoxification).\nIndonesian traditional beliefs on the common cold\nAmongst several traditional theories surrounding the common cold is the ‘cold weather theory’, which regards cold, in the context of the absence of heat, to be responsible for the illness.\nIn Indonesia, this belief takes the form of the concept known as Masuk Angin, or literally, trapped wind.\nThe symptoms of Masuk Angin include headache, nausea, fever, mild fatigue, vomiting and diarrhoea.\nThe concept of Masuk Angin in Indonesia may be related to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) belief that natural forces, including the wind, can disrupt bodily balance, leading to illness.\nIn TCM, the wind is considered to manifest in the highest and the outer parts of the body such as the face, skin, sweat glands and lungs.\nWhen classifying different types of infectious diseases, wind is the medium for transmission and can be ‘passed from one to another’. Invasion of the wind weakens the body’s immune defensive capabilities and causes a mismatch in the opening and closing of the pores.\nThis leads to the invasion of pathogens and, ultimately, to development of the common cold.\nThere are several traditional Indonesian treatments for Masuk Angin.\nJamu herbal remedies are commonly used to treat Masuk Angin and are readily available in most pharmacies and convenience stores across Indonesia – one remedy even carries the slogan, ‘reject the wind’.\nJamu shares many aspects with TCM such as treating ‘hot’ illnesses with ‘cold’ remedies.\nThere are also other widely used traditional therapies, such as cupping and skin scraping (\nkerokan\n), which aim to remove the trapped wind through the skin surface.\nThese therapies, along with Jamu, operate with the principle of removing excess wind to regain balance within the body, similar to the concept of removing excess congestion in modern medicine.\nHerbal medicines for the common cold – Ayurveda and Jamu\nAs outlined above, herbal ingredients form the core component of both Ayurvedic and Jamu systems.\nFour herbs – ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint – have been extensively used for the management of common cold symptoms in both Ayurveda and Jamu for thousands of years. Furthermore, regardless of the therapeutic systems and geographic differences, their pharmacological properties have now been confirmed through clinical evidence. Additionally, the following section will survey the use of these herbal ingredients in Ayurveda and Jamu and evaluate their standing in local and international monographs. The usage of herbs based on various therapeutic systems and their pharmacology is summarized in\nTable 1\nTable 1.\nUsage of herbs based on various therapeutic systems and their pharmacology.\nHerb\nAyurveda\nJamu\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nPharmacology\nGinger\nZingiber officinale\n(Śun.t.hī, Ārdraka)\nProperties:\nAntitussive (Kaphahara)\nCardioprotective (Hridya)\nAppetite stimulating (Dipana)\nTreatment for:\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Śvāsa)\nPain (Śūla)\nConstipation (Vibandha)\nFlatulence (Ānāha)\nInflammation (Śopha)\nNeck disorders (Kan.tharoga)\nTreatment for:\nHeadache\nNausea\nVomiting\nInfluenza\nCough\nVertigo\nPreventive medicine for nausea and vomiting and an adjunct treatment for inflammatory diseases\nTreatment for cold and flu symptoms\nAs expectorant and antitussive to relieve symptoms of bronchitis, cough and colds\nAnti-inflammatory activity\nShogaol and ginger extracts inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities\nLiquorice\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\n(Yas.t.ī)\nProperties:\nStrength (Balya)\nPurifies blood (Vatapittajit)\nTreatment for:\nCough (Kāsa)\nPulmonary tuberculosis (Ks.aya)\nHoarseness (Svarabheda)\nOphthalmological disorders (Chakshuksha)\nTreatment for:\nRheumatic diseases\nCough with phlegm\nDemulcent for sore throat, expectorant for cough and bronchial build-up\nAs expectorant to relieve chest complaints including catarrhs, cough and bronchitis\nAntitussive activity primarily attributed to glycyrrhizin, which accelerates tracheal mucus secretion\nAnti-inflammatory activity is attributed to corticosteroid-like activity of glycyrrhizin\nTurmeric\nCurcuma longa\n(Haridrā)\nProperties:\nAnthelmintic (Kr.mighna)\nAntileprotic (Kus.haghna)\nSkin complexion improving (Varn.ya)\nAntidote (Vis.aghna)\nAntidiabetic (Pramehanāśaka)\nTreatment for:\nAsthma\nHypertension\nRheumatism\nTreatment of flatulence, acidity and atonic dyspepsia\nUse in pain and inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis, and treatment for asthma and cough\nAnti-inflammatory activity due to curcumin and its derivatives for its ability to scavenge oxygen radicals\nPeppermint\nMenthae piperitae\n(Satva)\nProperties:\nAppetite stimulating (Dipana)\nAntitussive (Kaphahara)\nOral hygiene improving (Mukha-śodhana)\nDigestive (Pācana)\nAnalgesic (Śulapraśamana and Vedanāsthāpana)\nTreatment for:\nChronic fever (Jīrna jvara)\nPain (Śūla)\nTreatment for:\nSore throat\nAntiseptic for oral germs\nRelieve symptoms of cough and cold, muscle pain, irritable bowel syndrome and headache\nFor treatment of fever, catarrhs and inflammation of the oral mucosa\nNasal cooling activity\nMenthol binds to TRPM8 to elicit cooling sensation\nAnalgesic activity\nMenthol causes cooling sensation on skin via TRPM8 receptor activation\nAntispasmodic activity\nPeppermint inhibits activation of calcium channels, which in turn leads to smooth muscle relaxation\nOpen in a new tab\nTRPM8, transient receptor potential melastatin.\nGinger (\nZingiber officinale\nUse in Ayurveda\nIn the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, ginger is referred to as Śun.t.hī (dried ginger) or Ārdraka (fresh ginger).\nGinger is described to have antitussive (Kaphahara), cardioprotective (Hridya) and appetite-stimulating (Dipana) properties and is traditionally used for relieving bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Śvāsa), pain (Śūla), constipation (Vibandha), flatulence (Ānāha), inflammation (Śopha) and neck disorders (Kan.tharoga).\nUse in Jamu\nGinger is used extensively in Jamu, and the National Agency of Drug and Food Control in Indonesia has classified it as a priority plant for medicinal use.\nUses of ginger in Jamu include treatment for headache, nausea and vomiting, influenza, cough, and vertigo.\nPharmacology\nExperimental studies have documented the pharmacological properties of ginger, including its anti-inflammatory properties. Shogaol and compounds from ginger extracts were shown to inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities in a dose-dependent manner.\nBoth of these enzymes are involved in the metabolism of prostaglandin E\nand leukotriene B\n, which are potent mediators of inflammation.\nAs such, one manner by which ginger exhibits anti-inflammatory properties may be due to its inhibitory effect on the production of inflammatory molecules.\nOther possible mechanisms for ginger’s anti-inflammatory activity may be via the inhibition of thromboxane synthase whilst raising prostacyclin level and inhibiting nitric oxide release.\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nGinger is used in modern medicine as a preventive medicine for nausea and vomiting and as an adjunct treatment for inflammatory diseases.\nThe anti-inflammatory property of ginger has been demonstrated in two clinical studies where injection of ginger extract and oral administration of ginger powder reported benefits in alleviating pain and swelling, respectively.\nThe use of ginger for the treatment of cold are described in the Chinese and African pharmacopoeias and the German Commission E Monograph.\nThe Health Canada natural health product monograph also states the use of ginger as an expectorant and antitussive to relieve symptoms of bronchitis, cough and colds.\nLiquorice (\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\nUse in Ayurveda\nThe Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India indexes the dried, unpeeled root of the liquorice plant as Yas.t.ī.\nIt is described to provide strength (Balya), treat ophthalmological disorders (Caksusya) and purify blood (Vatapittajit).\nAyurvedic uses of Yas.t.ī include treatment for cough (Kāsa), pulmonary tuberculosis (Ks.aya) and hoarseness of voice (Svarabheda).\nUse in Jamu\nLiquorice is traditionally used in Jamu for rheumatic diseases.\nIt is described in the official Indonesian Traditional Medicine Formularium for use against cough with phlegm.\nPharmacology\nGlycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid in liquorice have been shown to have corticosteroid-like activity, whilst liquiritin and its derivatives from liquorice extract were also reported to demonstrate antitussive effects.\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nThe WHO monograph on selected medicinal plants mentions the use of liquorice as a demulcent for sore throat and as an expectorant for cough and bronchial mucus build-up.\nThe Health Canada natural health product monograph states the use of liquorice in herbal medicine as an expectorant to relieve chest complaints, including for catarrhs, cough and bronchitis.\nTurmeric (\nCurcuma longa\nUse in Ayurveda\nTurmeric is referred to as Haridrā in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India.\nIt is described to possess anthelmintic (Kr.mighna), antileprotic (Kus.haghna), skin complexion-improving (Varn.ya), antidote (Vis.aghna) and antidiabetic (Pramehanāśaka) properties.\nTurmeric is used as an anti-inflammatory medicine as well as a galactagogue in Ayurvedic medicine.\nUse in Jamu\nTraditionally, turmeric is used in Jamu to treat many conditions, including asthma, hypertension and rheumatism.\nPharmacology\nThe anti-inflammatory activity of turmeric has been demonstrated in studies of experimentally induced inflammation.\nThe anti-inflammatory property of turmeric may be attributed to curcumin, believed to be the main anti-inflammatory constituent of turmeric, and its derivatives in scavenging oxygen radicals.\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nThe WHO monograph on selected medicinal plants states that the use of turmeric for the treatment of flatulence, acidity and atonic dyspepsia is supported by clinical data.\nThe monograph also mentions its use in pain and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis as well as for the treatment of asthma and cough.\nPeppermint (\nMenthae piperitae\nUse in Ayurveda\nPeppermint is indexed as Satva in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India.\nSatva is described to have appetite-stimulating (Dipana), antitussive (Kaphahara), oral hygiene-improving (Mukha-śodhana), digestive (Pācana) and analgesic (Śulapraśamana and Vedanāsthāpana) properties.\nTraditional use of Satva in Ayurveda includes relieving chronic fever (Jīrna jvara) and pain (Śūla).\nUse in Jamu\nThe use of peppermint in Jamu as described in the Indonesian Traditional Medicine Formularium is for use against sore throat and as an antiseptic against oral germs.\nPharmacology\nThe cooling sensation and analgesic properties elicited by peppermint are attributed to menthol.\nMenthol is widely used to relieve muscle and joint pains as this molecule stimulates analgesic effects.\nIn particular, menthol can bind and activate transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) ion channels, which play an essential role in detecting cold stimuli in peripheral sensory neurons.\nNerve fibres within the nasal mucosa are enriched with TRPM8 receptors.\nAccording to several preclinical studies, peppermint leaf extract, peppermint oil and menthol have been reported to also possess antispasmodic effects.\nThe antispasmodic effect of peppermint on tracheal muscle cells is likely through the inhibition of calcium channels, which in turn leads to smooth muscle relaxation.\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nThe herbal monograph adopted by the European Medicines Agency Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products recommended the use of peppermint oil for symptomatic relief of mild tension-type headache based on well-established use in topical application and relief of symptoms in coughs and cold based on traditional use in inhalation, oral or cutaneous applications.\nA study involving healthy volunteers observed a significantly reduced mean number of coughs following evoked stimulation in participants who were administered inhaled peppermint.\nThe German Commission E Monograph has supported the use of peppermint oil for the treatment of catarrh and inflammation of the oral mucosa.\nThe WHO monograph on selected medicinal plants states that the use of peppermint is clinically proven for irritable bowel syndrome and headache.\nOther uses include treatment of fever, catarrh and cough.\nDiscussion\nThe inflammatory response is an important body defence mechanism during a viral cold infection for the prevention of spreading and killing of viruses.\nIt is often characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, tumour necrosis-α and IL-1β, giving rise to symptoms like cough, blocked nose, sore throat and fever.\nCurcumin, the active component of turmeric, is demonstrated to provide protection against inflammation via suppression of the NF-κB, PPARγ and TLR4 inflammation signalling pathways.\nClinically, consumption of curcumin supplement was reported to reduce common cold symptoms and shorten cold duration, although the inflammatory cytokine levels are highly variable in acute disease like the common cold.\nSimilar clinical anti- inflammatory actions by ginger were observed and exemplified in chronic and severe respiratory conditions.\nLiquorice and peppermint were clinically demonstrated to be effective antitussive agents against cough\nas well as to possess anti-inflammatory actions via corticosteroid-like activity\nand IL-10 modulation,\nrespectively.\nIn this review, we have surveyed the use of four herbal therapies – ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint – for the management of symptoms of the common cold as approached by the Ayurveda and Jamu medicinal systems. Overall, we have uncovered that these herbs have been used for centuries to treat symptoms of the common cold. Recent studies have supported their use in complementing modern evidence-based medicine.\nFurthermore, the use of these traditional herbal ingredients is supported by monographs from expert organizations such as WHO. However, whilst some studies may show limited objective benefit of inhaled aromatic ointments containing menthol for the common cold, the subjective benefits provided to patients have demonstrated improved sleep quality and accelerated recovery.\nFurthermore, the use of these traditional herbal ingredients is supported by monographs from expert bodies such as WHO.\nDespite the potential benefits of CAM, there are several issues surrounding the use of herbal ingredients for the treatment of the common cold in the general population. There are concerns regarding their safety as many herbal formulations are not tested or monitored with equal scrutiny as modern medicines.\nThese concerns are exacerbated by the lack of standardization, inappropriate labelling and inadequate patient information.\nHence, there is a need for regulatory bodies to proactively introduce measures to ensure patient safety in using herbal medicines.\nConclusion\nFor centuries, the Ayurveda and Jamu systems of medicine, originating from India and Indonesia, respectively, have leveraged herbal therapies to treat many illnesses. Herbs form the foundation of Ayurveda and Jamu, and ingredients like ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint have been used for centuries to treat several symptoms of the common cold. Recently, pharmacological evidence has demonstrated that the benefits of these herbal ingredients may be attributed to their anti-inflammatory effects.\nOn top of their traditional uses, herbal ingredients have seen an upsurge in acceptance in both the developing and developed world. Herbal ingredients like ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint have now been accepted into local and international monographs as suitable treatments for common cold symptoms. Given the widespread patient usage of CAM, a better understanding of this treatment paradigm by healthcare providers can be instrumental in bridging patient communication to potentially improve patient care. To improve healthcare provider acceptance of CAM, education should focus on the identity and pharmacology of phytochemicals in many herbal medicines as well as the clinical effectiveness of such molecules towards treating illnesses like the common cold.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Paulette Marks from Procter & Gamble South African Trading (Pty) Ltd for support in the expert roundtable implementation and Isuru Wijesoma, PhD, from McCann Health Singapore and Antony Hardjojo, PhD, from Jaya Medical Writing Pte Ltd for medical writing support for this article.\nFootnotes\nContributions:\nAll authors participated in the conceptualization, methodology, writing, original draft preparation, reviewing and editing of the manuscript.

    "content": "Abstract\nBackground:\nThe common cold is typically managed with decongestants, antihistamines, antitussives and antipyretics. In addition to these established medications, herbal ingredients have been used over centuries to help treat common cold symptoms. The Ayurveda and Jamu systems of medicine, originating from India and Indonesia, respectively, have leveraged herbal therapies to treat many illnesses.\nMethod:\nAn expert roundtable discussion comprising specialists in Ayurveda, Jamu, pharmacology and surgery along with a literature review was conducted to evaluate the use of four herbs – ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint – for common cold symptom management in Ayurvedic texts, Jamu publications and monographs from the World Health Organization, Health Canada and various European guidelines.\nDiscussion:\nDue to a lack of antivirals, common cold management revolves around maintaining personal hygiene and symptom management. Herbal medicines have been an integral part of many cultures worldwide. Despite its growing acceptance, there is a perception that healthcare providers lack interest and may prevent patients from discussing the use of herbal medicines. Limited education and training may also widen the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers, hindering effective management.\nConclusion:\nEvaluation of scientific evidence and the standing in international monographs can offer perspectives on the use of herbal medicines for common cold management."

    "content": "Ayurvedic Remedies for Common Cold and Flu\nAnish\nFebruary 28, 2025\nAs the seasons change, our bodies become more susceptible to respiratory illnesses such as the common cold and influenza (flu). While conventional medicine provides quick relief, Ayurveda offers a holistic approach that focuses on boosting immunity, reducing inflammation, and restoring balance to the body. This article explores the differences between the common cold and flu and presents Ayurvedic remedies that can help prevent and manage these conditions effectively.\nThe common cold and influenza are both viral respiratory illnesses, but they differ in severity and duration.\nThe common cold is a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection caused by viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, or adenovirus. It is characterized by symptoms like sneezing, nasal congestion, coughing, sore throat, and low-grade fever. These symptoms typically resolve within seven to ten days without requiring medical intervention.\nIn contrast, influenza is a more severe and potentially life-threatening illness caused by the influenza virus. It presents with a rapid onset of high fever, headaches, body aches, sore throat, and nasal congestion. Unlike the common cold, influenza can lead to complications, hospitalization, and increased mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and individuals with compromised immune systems. The symptoms of influenza may persist for more than two weeks, whereas those of the common cold usually subside within a week.\nAyurvedic Herbs to Combat Cold and Flu\nIncorporating powerful Ayurvedic herbs into daily routines can help alleviate symptoms, boost immunity, and promote overall well-being.\nTulsi, also known as holy basil, is highly valued in Ayurveda for its antiviral and antibacterial properties. It helps relieve congestion, expel mucus, and strengthen the immune system. Tulsi can be consumed in the form of tea, a decoction known as Kashaya, or simply by chewing its fresh leaves.\nGiloy, also called Amrith, is another potent herb known for its immunomodulatory properties. It enhances the body's natural defense mechanisms, reduces inflammation, and helps the body recover from infections.\nGinger is widely recognized for its warming and anti-inflammatory properties. It aids in breaking down excess mucus and reducing congestion. Drinking ginger tea, prepared by boiling fresh slices of ginger in water for a few minutes, can provide relief from cold symptoms.\nPippali, also known as long pepper, has been traditionally used to treat respiratory ailments. It is particularly effective in relieving cough, headaches, and nasal congestion associated with colds and flu.\nTurmeric, with its active compound curcumin, possesses strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It helps soothe sore throats and supports respiratory health.\nBlack pepper is a natural expectorant that aids in clearing the respiratory tract and reducing phlegm. When combined with turmeric, honey, and ginger, it enhances their effectiveness in managing cold symptoms.\nAmla, or Indian gooseberry, is a rich source of vitamin C and acts as a powerful immunity booster. Consuming Amla powder mixed with honey twice daily strengthens the respiratory system and provides anti-allergic benefits.\nEffective Ayurvedic Remedies for Cold and Cough Relief\nWhen cold and flu symptoms appear, several natural remedies can provide relief and aid in recovery.\nGargling with warm salt water is a simple yet highly effective method to reduce throat swelling, loosen mucus, and eliminate bacteria. Mixing a small amount of salt in warm water and gargling several times a day can soothe a sore throat and prevent further infection.\nDrinking masala tea with extra ginger is another soothing remedy. A warm cup of tea brewed with black tea, fresh ginger, and a pinch of cinnamon can help relieve inflammation and provide comfort during a cold.\nHydration plays a crucial role in clearing mucus from the respiratory system. Drinking hot water throughout the day helps flush out toxins, hydrate the mucus membranes, and loosen congestion. Adding lemon or honey enhances the therapeutic effects of hot water.\nGolden milk, a traditional Ayurvedic remedy made with turmeric-infused milk, is highly beneficial for respiratory health. Mixing a small amount of turmeric powder with warm milk and honey creates a nourishing drink that boosts immunity and alleviates cold symptoms. Consuming this before bedtime provides additional comfort.\nSteam inhalation is another natural decongestant therapy that can help clear nasal passages and alleviate sinus congestion. Inhaling steam infused with eucalyptus oil or menthol provides relief from respiratory discomfort. Covering the head with a towel and inhaling the steam for several minutes multiple times a day can provide significant relief.\nDietary adjustments play a vital role in recovery. Consuming warm, nourishing foods such as soups, herbal teas, and easily digestible meals strengthens the immune system and aids in healing. It is advisable to avoid heavy, fried foods, dairy products, refined flour, and cold beverages, as these can worsen congestion and delay recovery.\nConclusion:\nAyurveda offers a time-tested and holistic approach to managing colds and flu by strengthening immunity, reducing inflammation, and restoring balance. By incorporating Ayurvedic herbs, home remedies, and mindful dietary habits, individuals can effectively prevent and recover from respiratory infections. While these remedies provide significant relief, those experiencing severe or persistent symptoms should seek medical attention when necessary.\n1. What are the common causes of cold and flu according to Ayurveda?\nAyurveda considers cold and flu as imbalances in the Kapha and Vata doshas, often triggered by seasonal changes, poor digestion, or weakened immunity. Ayurvedic remedies focus on restoring balance and enhancing the body's natural healing process.\n2. Which Ayurvedic herbs help in relieving cold and flu symptoms?\n-Tulsi (Holy Basil):\nStrengthens immunity and relieves congestion.\n-Giloy (Amrith):\nEnhances the body's natural defenses and fights infections.\n-Ginger:\nReduces mucus and inflammation in the respiratory tract.\n-Pippali (Long Pepper):\nEffective in treating cough and congestion.\n-Turmeric:\nHas anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.\n-Black Pepper:\nActs as an expectorant and aids in clearing mucus.\n-Amla (Indian Gooseberry):\nRich in vitamin C, it enhances respiratory health and immunity.\n3. What foods should be avoided during cold and flu?\nAvoid:\n-Dairy products (as they increase mucus production).\n-Fried, heavy, and processed foods.\n-Cold beverages and refrigerated foods.\n-Refined flour-based foods (as they slow digestion).\n4. How does Nasya therapy help in cold and flu prevention?\nNasya involves applying medicated oil (such as Anu Taila or sesame oil) into the nostrils to lubricate the nasal passages, clear congestion, and prevent respiratory infections. It is especially beneficial during seasonal transitions.\n5. What lifestyle practices can help prevent frequent colds and flu?\n- Maintain a consistent sleep schedule to support immunity.\n- Avoid exposure to cold winds and damp environments.\n- Practice oil massage (Abhyanga) with sesame oil to strengthen the body.\n- Follow a daily routine (Dinacharya) that aligns with natural rhythms.\nRecent Blogs\nAyurvedic Management of Bronchitis\nSeptember 25, 2025\nAyurvedic Management of Tonsillitis\nSeptember 22, 2025\nAyurvedic Treatment for Hypertension\nSeptember 15, 2025\nAyurvedic Treatment for...\nSeptember 11, 2025\nAyurvedic Treatment for Muscular Dystrophy\nAugust 22, 2025\nAyurvedic Treatment For Neurological...\nAugust 13, 2025"

The global incidence of ILI is estimated at 5–10% in adults and 20–30% in children. In India influenza accounts for 20–42% of monthly acute medical illness hospitalizations during the peak rainy season. AYUSH-64, a poly-herbal drug, is in practice for 40 years for various clinical conditions like fevers, microfilaremia, and inflammatory conditions.\nObjective\nA pilot study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ayurvedic formulation, AYUSH-64 in clinically diagnosed ILI for accelerating the recovery.\nMaterial and Methods\nA prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, single group, single-center pilot clinical study with pre-test and post-test design was conducted at Raja Ramdeo Anandilal Podar Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, Mumbai, an institute of Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) between June 2018 and July 2019. A total of 38 participants of clinically diagnosed ILI (18–65 years) were studied with an one-week intervention of ‘AYUSH 64’ in a dose of 3 gm/day and three weeks post-treatment observation period. Assessment of parameters viz. improvement in the symptoms of ILI, frequency of usage of acetaminophen, antihistaminic and cough syrup, hematology, liver function and kidney function tests along with incidence of secondary complications, and time to return to a normal routine was done.\nResults\nOne-week intervention of AYUSH 64 helped to recover from ILI symptoms with reduced frequency of usage of acetaminophen and antihistaminic. The intervention was safe on hematology and biochemical parameters. No serious adverse effects were observed during the study.\nConclusion\nAYUSH 64 along-with standard care in ILI is safe and efficacious and this may be used in other viral infections with pyrexia as add-on to standard care for early recovery and better outcome.\nKeywords:\nInfluenza-like illness (ILI),\nVata-Kaphaja Jvara\n, AYUSH 64, Safety, Efficacy, Ayurveda intervention\n1. Introduction\nInfluenza is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide including low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in tropical regions like India where highest point estimates rates of Influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza-associated ILI among young and older adults [\n]. ILI refers to a wide range of viral infections with clinical manifestation ranging from fever, malaise and other constitutional symptoms mostly depending upon tissue, organ affected, host defense, age of the patient, and the affecting strain of the virus and bacterial load. Management of uncomplicated ILI remains symptom-based rather than antiviral therapy where in antipyretic, antihistaminic or cough syrup is used for symptomatic relief which again has its own side effects. Patients are advised to take rest and maintain proper hydration during illness and asked to return to full activity after gradual recovery from illness. Viruses constantly change their antigenicity as a strategy for evasion from immune-mediated elimination [\n]. The classical example is of influenza virus where this strategy leads to the emergence of new strains and the failure of previously generated immunity protects against fresh infections. This has led to the difficulties in generating vaccines against these infections. The unavailability of optimal medication which would effectively hinder the disease pathogenesis while easing the recovery process and simultaneously boosting the immune mechanism has probed the exploration of traditional and such other medicines to promote natural healing in ILI.\nThe clinical presentation of ILI is similar with\nVata-Kapha Jvara\n(fever with predominance of\nVata and Kapha dosha\n) as per the description in Ayurveda classics [\n]. The treatment of\nJvara\naims at digestion of\nama\n(partially digested metabolic waste) through\nlanghana\n(fasting/restricted calorie intake) and formulations (single herb/polyherbal) containing ingredients having\ntikta rasa, ushna virya, katu vipaka\nand\namapachaka\n(anti-inflammatory) properties [\n]. Many botanicals which are documented in Ayurveda Pharmacopoeia viz.\nSwertia chirata\nKiratatikta), Alstonia scholaris (Saptaparna), Pircrorria kurroa (Kutaki)\netc. are traditionally used for fevers like malaria [\n]. AYUSH 64, a polyherbal formulation is in practice since 1980s against various conditions like fevers, inflammation and joint pains across CCRAS peripheral institutes. Its efficacy has been reported in conditions like\nVishamjvara\n(malarial fever),\nShleepada\n(microfilaremia) and chikungunya. During the malaria epidemic in Rajasthan and Assam in 1994 and 1996 respectively, AYUSH 64 was used in 3600 fever cases in Rajasthan and 2294 fever cases in Assam. A decline in infectivity rate was observed when AYUSH 64 was given to all fever cases along with anti-malarial, and a good response was reported in villages where AYUSH 64 administration was done on prophylaxis basis for fever cases [\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\nVishamjvara\nand\nVata-kapha jvara\nvis-à-vis ILI are the types of\nJvara\nand share common pathology, however\nVata\nand\nKapha doshas\nare predominant in ILI and manifest symptoms as\nShitaka\n(chills),\nGaurava\n(heaviness),\nParvaruka\n(pain in small joints),\nPratishyaya\n(cold/catarrh), and\nKasa\n(cough), etc. The ingredients in AYUSH 64 are\nJwarahara\n(useful in fevers)\n, Shwasa-Kaasaghna\n(useful in asthma, cough)\n, Shothahara\n(relieves inflammation). Details of pharamalogical profile of plant ingredients present in AYUSH 64 is provided in\nTable 1\n. On this background, this pilot study was aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of AYUSH64 in the management of clinically diagnosed ILI.\nTable 1.\nDetails of pharmacological profile of plant ingredients present in AYUSH 64.\nName of the plant\nRasa\nGuna\nVirya\nVipaaka\nKarma\nSaptaparna\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n(Alstonia scholaris\nR.

Methods\n2.1. Study design and trail site\nAs 4-week single-center pilot study was conducted in a prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single group, pre and post-test design at Raja Ramdeo Anandilal Podar Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, an institute of CCRAS, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India.\n2.2. Patient enrolment and inclusion criteria\nPatients who were clinically diagnosed cases with ILI having axillary temperature ≥38 °C and with at least two constitutional symptoms (headache, chills, myalgia or fatigue) and one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat or coryza) with the onset of illness since not more than 36 h, of either sex, age between 18 and 65 years and who voluntarily signed the informed consent to participate in the study were included in the study.\n2.3. Exclusion criteria\nExclusion criteria were the following: Cases of bronchitis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, interstitial lesions, patients having white blood cells (WBC) count greater than the upper limit of normal (WBC>11.0 × 10\nL) and lesser than normal (WBC<4.0 × 10\n/L) or neutrophil count ≥75%, patients coughing purulent sputum or with suppurative tonsillitis, patients with uncontrolled diabetes, COPD, hepatic insufficiency (ALT or AST 2 times above normal or higher); renal insufficiency (serum creatinine more than the upper lab value); chronic congestive heart failure, psychiatric diseases, patients who already have taken antiviral drugs or related traditional medicine after the onset/before the screening, women in pregnancy or lactation period, women of childbearing age with a plan of a pregnancy, immune-compromised patients or taking immunosuppressant in last 3 months, with dubious or confirmed alcohol and drug abuse history, suffering from an acute respiratory infection, otitis media or sinusitis 2 weeks before, with history of vaccination for seasonal or new influenza A (H1N1) vaccine 6 months before.\n2.4. Consent and ethical approval\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of this institute and registered prospectively at CTRI (CTRI/2017/10/010145 Registered on: 23/10/2017). Recruitment of participants was done as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria after taking informed written consent from the eligible patients.\n2.5. Intervention\nThe study drug AYUSH-64 was procured from Indian Medicines Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited (IMPCL) Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Each capsule of AYUSH 64 consists of\nA. scholaris\nR. Br (\nSaptaparna)\nbark aqueous extract 100 mg,\nkurroa\nRoyle ex. Benth\n(Katuki\n) root aqueous extract 100 mg,\nhirata\nPexbex. Karst (\nKiratatikta\n) whole-plant aqueous extract 100 mg,\ncrista\nL. (\nKuberaksha\n) seed powder 200 mg. Quality control and safety parameters of the ingredients and the formulation complied with API limits/Inhouse limits as appropriate (Quality Control Analysis enclosed as\nsupplementary files\nThe drug was given in a dose of 2 capsules (500 mg) thrice daily i.e. 3 gm/day orally after food along-with water for 7 days from baseline. One of the authors, a specialist in modern medicine prescribed acetaminophen, antihistaminic and cough syrup as per the standard guidelines and monitored the patients along with\nAyurveda\nphysicians.\n2.6. Outcome measure/efficacy evaluation\nThe efficacy evaluation of the drug was done by assessing the ILI symptoms viz. fever, headache, myalgia, running nose, nasal obstruction/congestion, cough, sore throat, fatigue, chills/aversion to cold and sweating. The symptoms were assessed on a scale of 0–100 cm using VAS, where 0 represents no symptom and 100 represents the maximum severity of the symptom [\n]. These symptoms were assessed at baseline and on 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day. Improvement in fever was measured as time to defervescence, i.e. the time from the first dose of study medication to the time when the body temperature declined to 37.4 °C or below and was sustained for ≥24 h. Severity of the illness was assessed by computing the area under the curve (AUC) for all the symptoms together. Average score of all the ten symptoms for each patient was computed for calculating the AUC. The area under the curve was evaluated between two consecutive time points. Integration approximating with the trapezoidal rule was used to calculate the areas [\n]. The frequency of usage of acetaminophen, antihistaminic and cough syrup and incidence of secondary complications of ILI e.g. bronchitis, otitis media, pneumonitis etc. and adverse reactions related to the intervention were noted at all visits. The time to return to normal state of health and activity was defined as the time (in hours) from study drug initiation to the first 24h period in which participants returned to their normal state and remained so for 24h. The participants were assessed for Ayurvedic variables with the interest to study diagnostic classifications according to\nAyurved\nTable 2\nTable 2.\nTimeline procedure of the study.\nTime Points\nSchedule of Activity\nPrior to selection (Screening Visit)\nInformed consent\nEligibility evaluation\nAssessment for ILI symptoms\nGeneral and systemic examination\nLaboratory Investigations (CBC, Urine, LFT, KFT, ECG)\nDuring Selection (Baseline Visit, 0 day)\nDetailed case history along with assessment of Ayurvedic Parameters\nIssue of the trial drug and drug compliance form (DCF)\nDuring Intervention (3\nDay)\nClinical assessment\nResponse assessment for ILI symptoms using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)\nRecord of the need for any rescue/concomitant medication\nRecord drug compliance and ADR/ADE\nEnd of Intervention (7\nDay)\nClinical assessment\nResponse assessment for ILI symptoms using VAS\nRecord of the need for any rescue/concomitant medication\nLaboratory Investigations (CBC, Urine, LFT, KFT)\nRecord drug compliance and ADR/ADE\nObtaining remaining trial drug from participant\nPost Intervention- Follow-up (14\nand 21\nDay)\nClinical assessment\nResponse assessment for ILI symptoms using VAS\nRecord of the need for any rescue/concomitant medication\nPost Intervention Follow-up (28\nDay)\nClinical assessment\nResponse assessment for ILI symptoms using VAS\nRecord of need of any rescue/concomitant medication\nLaboratory Investigations (CBC)\nOpen in a new tab\n2.7.

Secondary complications of ILI were not observed during the study period in any participant. No serious adverse reactions related to the intervention were reported in any participant.\n4. Discussion\nILI refers to a wide range of viral infections, quite common in children and old people due to lowered immunity. The conventional management of ILI depends on severity, mild to moderate cases of category A and B are managed by acetaminophen, antihistaminic and severe cases of category C are treated with antiviral, antibiotics, intravenous fluids and other supportive care [\n]. In an internet-based cohort study, it was found that the quality-adjusted life-day (QALD) loss was found to be over three times higher for ILI than for acute respiratory infections [\n]. Early recovery is needed for returning to jobs/works along-with arrest to spread of infection. The innate immune response plays a crucial role in the viral elimination and recovery from disease.\nIt is reported that the symptom scores in influenza infections are directly correlated with IL-6 and IFN-α [\n]. Significant production of IL-6, TNF- α, IFN- α, IFN-γ and IL-10 occurs in response to community acquired influenza A illness [\n]. Bian et al. has noted that the levels of interleukin (IL)- 6, IL-33 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α were significantly higher in Influenza A patients while IL-6, IL-17 A, IL-29, interferon (IFN)- γ and interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10 were significantly higher in Influenza B patients [\nMultiple host-based intervention strategies against influenza are under development and these offer advantages over conventional antivirals. New therapeutic options in the treatment of Influenza infection will be targeting virus-induced metabolic changes to restore host normal metabolism, and research in the immunometabolism field along with studies on modulating immune response [\n]. A class of herbal medicines, known as immunomodulators vis-à-vis\nRasayana\n, modulate the secretion of multiple cytokines [\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\nThe botanicals in AYUSH-64, reported to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity. The aqueous bark extract of\nA. scholaris\nin BALB/c mouse induced the cellular immune response at 50 mg/kg body weight once a day for 7 consecutive days while at 100 mg/kg body weight inhibited the delayed type of hypersentivity reaction [\n]. Yun-Li Zhao et al. studied the effects of indole alkaloids and total alkaloids of\nA. scholaris\non post infectious cough in mice and airway inflammation in rats respectively. Indole alkaloids showed down-regulation of inflammatory cells, cytokines (IL-6) and the balance of antioxidants. Total alkaloids inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung [\nThe biopolymeric fraction RLJ-NE-205 from the rhizomes of\nkurroa\nimproved the immune system of mouse through increased proliferation of lymphocytes and cytokine levels (IL-4 and IFN-gamma) in serum, phagocytic index and CD4/CD8 population [\n]. Pre-treatment with\nkurroa\nrhizome extract exhibited anti-inflammatory activity through the suppression of macrophage-derived cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10) and mediators via suppression of NF-κB signaling [\n]. Picroside II, active ingredient from\nscrophulariiflora\nshowed the promising effects of anti-inflammation in cells and animals through decrease in concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. It suppressed the activation of p65 NF-κB signaling pathway compared with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The pathologic changes of lung tissues had been alleviated and lung wet/dry weight ratio was decreased after Picroside II treatment [\nSwertia chirata\nis found to inhibit NF-kB/DNA interactions and also reduced pro-inflammatory IL- 8 expression in cystic fibrosis cells at IC\nconcentrations [\n]. Bellidifolin and Swerchirin, the two main xanthones from\nchirata\ninhibit the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- α. Bellidifolin potently inhibited the prostaglandin E\n(PGE\n) by suppressing the protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [\n]. The CHCl\nsoluble, crude extract of the whole\nchirata\ninhibited the expression of Viral protein R (Vpr) in HeLa cells harboring the TREx plasmid encoding full-length Vpr (TREx-HeLa-Vpr cells) [\n]. Crude extract of\nswertia\nplant showed antiviral properties against Herpes simplex virus type-1 [\nAdministration of methanolic extracts of\nC. crista\nreduced TNF- α, IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA expression in hippocampus and the frontal cortex brain areas in rats [\nCaesalpinia bonducella\nseed extract produced dose dependent increase in both the parameters, i.e. antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity in rats indicating promising immunostimulant properties [\n]. A water-soluble gluco-arabinan isolated from the alkaline extract of the endosperm of seeds of\nC. bonducella\nshowed immunostimulant activity through splenocytes and thymocytes activations [\n]. Whole ethanolic seed extract of\nC. bonducella\nseeds in experimental albino rats displayed anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities [\nAs per the Ayurvedic understanding, the weakened\nAgni\nJvara\nleads to formation of\nAma (\nproinflammatory undigested substance\nleading to\namavastha\nthat results into weak immune status. The Ayurvedic management aims at correction of\nAgni\nstatus through\nAgnideepana\nand\nAmapachana\nresulting into\nniramavastha\n(devoid of\nama\n) i.e. reversing the pathology and improving the immune status. The ingredients in AYUSH 64 are having\nTikta rasa\nwhich is\nAgnideepak and Amapachak\n(anti-inflammatory). AYUSH 64 acts as\namapachaka\nand converts the status from\nsama\nnirama. Niramavastha\nresults into restoring the normal metabolism and strengthening immune status.\nIn this study, the declining trend in symptoms of ILI is seen from the 3rd day of intervention to the 7th day. The combination effect of botanicals is\nJwarahara\n(relieves fever)\n, Kasahara\n(useful in cough), and\nShwasahara\n(useful in asthma). This effect is seen from the reduction in the requirement of acetaminophen from 3rd day onwards after the intervention and minimal use of antihistaminic and cough syrup during the study period. The recovery time and returning to normal life was 3rd day in 6 patients, 7th day for 17 patients and 14th day for 3 patients. The seven-day treatment of AYUSH 64 along with standard care has shown reduction in symptoms of majority patients. Symptoms like fever,\nsvedapravartana, shitaka, staimitya\ntandra\nparvaruk\nkasa\nhave shown sharp decline by 7th day of intervention. The post-treatment follow-up period has seen mild symptoms and requirement of antihistaminic and acetaminophen in 7 patients. Declining trend was seen in all the symptoms of ILI with fairly early recovery, however a longer duration of AYUSH 64 may have shown better results in terms of the restoration of metabolism and further strengthening the immune status. As far herb–drug interaction is concerned, AYUSH 64 was used along-with standard antimalarial treatment in earlier malaria epidemic. In this study the seven-day administration of AYUSH 64 along with standard care was tolerated well and no adverse events were recorded.\n4.1. Limitations\nThis is single-group pre and post test design study with a small sample size and was focused on clinically diagnosed ILI condition with only clinical safety related biochemical parameters. However, for substantial evidence, a larger multicentric study with a robust design with standard diagnostic investigations and cytokine response will be helpful to validate the efficacy of this drug.\n5. Conclusion\nAYUSH 64 along-with standard care in ILI is safe and efficacious and it may be used in other viral infections with pyrexia as an add-on to standard care for early recovery and better outcome.\nClinical Trial Registry\nClinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), number: CTRI/2017/10/010145.\nSource of support\nCCRAS, Ministry of AYUSH, GoI.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nNil.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors are thankful to CCRAS, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India for grants for this study under CCRAS Research policy.\nFootnotes\nPeer review under responsibility of Transdisciplinary University, Bangalore.\nAppendix A\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2020.05.010\nAppendix A.

It involves problem definition, followed by solution design, solution implementation, and, finally, review. Healthcare is a prime and often successful example of problem-solving. In medical terminology, the problem definition is termed the diagnosis, the solution design is called the treatment plan, and the solution itself is the provision of treatment. The case review is used to assess the efficacy of the solution. This process is sequential and consequential. Obviously, if a problem’s definition is absent or incorrect, then an appropriate solution cannot be designed or implemented. Unfortunately, missed or incorrect diagnoses are not uncommon in healthcare and can cause considerable harm and economic cost. Minimizing these diagnostic errors would confer great benefits to patients, clinicians, and healthcare organizations. Understanding the nature of diagnosis and why it can be so difficult are some of the first steps in reducing these diagnostic errors. One issue is that diagnosis may seem to be more of an art than a science when the exact mechanisms of diagnosis are often not clearly described. Clinicians typically learn their diagnostic craft by mimicry of their mentors over years of hard experience. This absence of a clear method not only makes diagnosis difficult to do well it also makes diagnosis difficult to teach well. The purpose of this paper is to try to better articulate the fundamental principles and methods of diagnosis and to make diagnosis more intellectually understandable, and so more teachable, and more achievable by clinicians.\nKeywords:\nclinical decision rules, decision support techniques, clinical decision making, diagnostic error, diagnostic systems, diagnostic technique\nIntroduction and background\nProblem-solving is an important part of human activity. Typically, problems are identified, solutions are designed and implemented, and the outcome is reviewed. In healthcare, the main problem to be solved is a disease. Identification of disease is termed diagnosis, the solution design is called treatment planning, and treatment where appropriate is then implemented as the solution. Case review determines the outcome. These four stages are linearly dependent. Therefore, an error in diagnosis can lead to consequent errors in treatment planning, hence in treatment given, which then leads to a poor outcome on review. Incorrect diagnoses may cause patient harm, operator stress, and economic loss [\n]. Unfortunately, diagnostic errors are commonplace [\n]. There is a need to minimize these diagnostic errors and their harm [\n]. This is often difficult when healthcare domains are usually complex and incompletely understood, even by domain experts [\n]. Moreover, effective teaching of diagnostic skills requires that the principles are consciously understood [\n]. The aim of this paper is to describe the fundamentals of the diagnostic process to aid its understanding, teaching, and implementation.\nReview\nThe language of diagnosis\nThe term diagnosis is part of the fabric of medical language, and indeed elsewhere. Despite this ubiquity, many users may be oblivious to the origin of the word, which remarkably tells us its fundamental meaning. It is no accident that in the 1600s the word diagnosis was derived from two Latin words, which, in turn, came from ancient Greek. The English-language versions of the two words are\ngnosis\n(“to know”) and\ndia\n(“apart”) (Figure\n) [\n]. These two words indicate an ability to recognize (know) one condition as separate (apart) from another; that is, to discriminate between health and disease and between different diseases. That the original literal meaning has endured so precisely into modern times demonstrates the word’s utility.\nFigure 1. Google search: etymology of the word diagnosis.\nOpen in a new tab\nSo, we now know the meaning of the word diagnosis. But the word alone does not instruct us how to make a diagnosis, or how to teach a diagnostic method. Making a diagnosis is done by system analysis.\nSystem analysis\nTo understand a diagnostic method, it is essential to consider the fundamental system in which a diagnosis is to be made [\n]. This can be complicated, so bear with me. At a basic level, our patient is made up of many aggregated complex parts and processes [\n]. This complex whole system is difficult to understand when the different parts and processes obscure each other, often confounding the interpretation of cause and effect. The scientific method uses deconstruction to break up that complexity into smaller isolated parts, which can be more easily understood with logic [\n]. Once properly understood, these smaller structures and mechanisms are then used to explain the behavior of the full working system as a model. So, to understand the system one has to identify its parts. Those parts can be described as elements or components [\n]. These system elements are defined by us as they occur in nature, or at least as we perceive them.\nEach element in the system can be working well or may be malfunctioning. In a healthy system, all elements will be in their correct state. Alternatively, if one or more elements are malfunctioning, then the system may malfunction, and in the medical sense, the disease is present [\n]. Many of these elements may be unrelated, but others may be linked, such that when one element varies then another element changes as well. Such a linkage between elements leads to consequences and dependence on downstream elements. In this way, an effect might propagate through the system from one element to the next as a relationship. If the nature of the relationship between elements is known, then the propagation of the effect would be predictable and could be described by logic rules or other reasoning methods. One or more logic rules can then define the model of the system’s behavior.\nLogic applied to a known element and its relationship to another element is the primary method to obtain a diagnosis [\n]. An example of such a logic statement might be the conclusion that increased redness of a body part may be due to increased blood flow at a histological level, which in some cases may be an indicator of the presence of inflammatory disease. This was first stated by the Roman, Celsus, in BC 30-38 [\n], perhaps the first recorded diagnostician.\nWhile useful, one logic statement about one system element may not be enough to clearly conclude a specific diagnosis. Several diagnoses could still be possible with that one element’s status. For example, reddened skin could be an indication of a traumatic injury, a sunburn, a noxious chemical, or merely a person being healthy but just too hot. Fortunately, the diagnostic method can be improved by considering multiple elements together. Typically, a malfunction propagates through the system from one or a few initial elements to affect multiple other dependent elements and thus magnifying the effect. This causes a cascade of malfunctioning elements to occur together, some of which then become detectable, all together. This situation gives the opportunity to cross-reference individual logic statements at the same time. One element may logically preclude or alternatively dictate some disease diagnoses. However, multiple logic statements together can then deduce a narrower subset of diagnoses, or even a single specific diagnosis. Considering multiple elements together becomes a more powerful way of discriminating any disease present.\nRather than laboriously reasoning each logic statement with its peers, an intellectual shortcut for this technique is simply to identify the defined set of failing elements that are known to occur in a specific pattern for a specific disease. Hence, pattern recognition is the second method by which a diagnosis is made [\n]. All one has to do is to remember each specific pattern that is indicative of each specific disease. An example of such pattern recognition might be used to conclude that tissue with increased redness, warmth, swelling, and pain all occurring together is suffering histological-level inflammation, such as dermatitis. These particular inflammation signs in such a pattern were, of course, first described as rubor, calor, tumor, and dolor in Roman times by Celsus [\n]. He understood this pattern recognition.\nIn the example above, clearly, redness, heat, swelling, and pain are not the initial failed elements causing the inflammatory disease. The disease usually occurs as a cascade of failing elements. It is common that the initial elements which fail often are microscopic, biochemical, internal, and difficult to detect clinically. However, their failure often leads to later consequential downstream failures of external elements, which may be clinically detectable. In such cases, the hidden internal failing elements can then be logically predicted from the altered and detectable external elements in the clinical domain. We call these proxy external elements symptoms if reported by our patient, and signs if detected by the clinician, perhaps with further tests. Some elements may be both a symptom and a sign if both clinician and patient detect them. Such external signs and symptoms exist as the result of the logic rules and fall into the patterns detected by the clinical diagnostic method.\nFurthermore, it can be seen that any disease process can be considered at two levels. A pathologist may describe the failing internal elements in great detail, typically on a microscopic, histological, or biochemical level [\n]. The clinician meanwhile views the same disease as external failing elements, typically as clinically detectable macroscopic signs and symptoms. It is as if the one disease is being described in two languages; that of the pathologist, and that of the clinician. Clinical diagnosis translates from the language of external signs and symptoms to the corresponding internal language of pathology, which specifies the disease label. Therefore, the process of diagnosis is like a translation between these two languages. Healthcare training thus teaches the two associated sets of information for each and every disease: the internal pathological features of the medical sciences, and the corresponding clinical features of signs and symptoms. Clinicians and pathologists need to be bilingual to be able to speak both languages.\nInexperienced clinicians may need to consciously think through each logic step or pattern matching, but with training, the diagnostic process may occur without explicit thought [\n]. Subconscious thinking has been termed System 1, as it is routine for experienced clinicians. Labored and slower conscious logical thought has been called System 2 [\n]. It may take years of instruction and practice for a clinician to become an expert at automated System 1 correlation for many diseases. But when a diagnosis is difficult even experienced clinicians may have to resort to System 2 [\n]. Not reverting to the slower conscious logic techniques (metacognition) where appropriate can lead to misdiagnoses [\n], although, as expected, one report showed that very expert clinicians could diagnose so well that more time did not improve their already good accuracy [\n]. Improved clinical and pathology knowledge [\n] and diagnostic checklists [\n] have also been proposed to reduce diagnostic errors.\nHow clinicians obtain and then ascribe value to clinical information has also been extensively studied [\n]. The clinician is initially in a position of ignorance at the start of the consultation. A series of three phases then occurs: to acquire data, to form a working hypothesis of possible diagnoses, and then to test and hopefully confirm a specific diagnosis with more data [\n]. Logic and pattern matching are used throughout, either consciously or subconsciously. Figure\ngives a protocol of the stages of the diagnostic process. The process is iterative so that if a diagnosis is not made, then more data can be collected and the process can be repeated. Perhaps counterintuitively, more experienced clinicians were found to spend more time on the initial data acquisition than did medical students, who tended to more quickly assume a diagnosis, perhaps in error [\nFigure 2. Diagnostic protocol.\nOpen in a new tab\nChallenges in diagnosis\nTherefore, the diagnostic method seems to be relatively straightforward to do. It is just logic statements and pattern recognition of disease models. Simple, right? So, how come diagnosis can often be very difficult? This is because there are some serious practical problems that can very much hinder the process.\nImperfect System Models\nFirst, disease systems are usually very complicated, and not all diseases are fully described or understood. Their etiology and pathogenesis may not have been clearly established as clear logic statements or as recognizable patterns [\n]. This ignorance can prevent diagnosis and motivates much ongoing medical research.\nUndetectable Elements\nSecond, the availability of relevant system elements is crucial to making a diagnosis. Some elements may never be detectable by any means [\n]. Therefore, diagnosis relying on such totally hidden elements is impossible. This is frustrating, especially when such hidden failing elements are often causal of the disease, and so would be highly diagnostic. Figure\nshows a Venn diagram of the relationship of the detectable information within the wider hidden information. An experienced clinician may in some cases be able to correctly interpolate absent information.\nFigure 3. System data and its analysis for clinical diagnosis.\nOpen in a new tab\nMisinformation\nThe clinician also may have to cope with some misinformation (Figure\n). Some of the available information may be just plain wrong. Patients forget or misconstrue the facts [\n], errors occur in clinical and laboratory tests and radiographs, and mistakes may be made in recording clinical data. Good diagnostic acumen includes the ability to disregard misinformation where appropriate.\nNatural Variation\nThe fourth practical problem is the natural variation found in all of nature. Charles Darwin explained his theory of evolution on the basis that system elements would be typically variable in a population of organisms [\n]. As the environment changes, this variance permits the survival of some fortunate members of a species under new selection pressures, leading to species adaptation. While this variance is useful in species survival by evolution, it can be the bane of a clinician’s efforts to diagnose her patients. The same disease in different patients, or even in the same patient at different times, can present with a different pattern of detectable elements [\n]. Some elements that are normally present may be absent. And some elements that are normally absent may be present. Indeed, there is a spectrum from health to disease, not necessarily with a clear demarcation between the two states. Significant variations in case presentations may put diagnoses in doubt. The logic and pattern recognition methods described above have to accommodate these natural variations, errors, and omissions. The diagnostic process therefore can be regarded as imperfectly defined or fuzzy in nature. Fuzzy logic [\n] is required to reach a diagnosis in the presence of natural variation [\n]. Rigid thinkers may be disappointed.\nWorkplace Limitations\nMedical workplaces are often stressful and busy environments where the workload is excessive [\n]. Repetitive tasking and fatigue may dull the observational senses and the mind [\n]. Moreover, some medical staff and patients may place a lower emphasis on diagnosis than on treatment when treatment may be seen as the definitive reason for the existence of the medical services. This erroneous emphasis is often reinforced by the often lesser remuneration available for diagnosis compared with treatment. All these workplace reasons may lead to greater misdiagnosis.\nThe limits of diagnostic method\nThe above problems of incomplete knowledge, hidden or misinformation, and natural variation have very real consequences. They set a limit on the diagnostic process. Clinician fatigue is also a detriment. Realistically then, in some cases, a specific diagnosis may not be possible. Often the data available may lead to only a provisional list of more likely diagnoses. This list is termed a differential diagnosis. It is essential that when a diagnosis is not certain that iatrogenically damaging treatments are not carried out. In all but emergency situations, it is better to seek more information with further testing, with further opinions from more experienced colleagues, or with more time, such that the true state of the patient can become apparent [\nDiagnosis and education\nIt can be seen from the above analysis that like many other skills, initially, the diagnosis has to be consciously learned [\n]. At first, we may not realize the full extent of our lack of skill. This has been termed unconscious incompetence [\n]. With education, a person moves on to realize they are unskilled (conscious incompetence), then hopefully with much intellectual analysis and effort they become consciously competent (System 2 behavior [\n]). Finally, when they are very experienced they may become unconsciously competent (System 1 behavior [\n]) and be able to perform the task without specifically analyzing each step. This learning transition was first proposed by Noel Burch in the 1970s for training staff in businesses and is now an established educational model [\n]. The final unconscious competence relies largely on what might be described as intuition, learned by years of experience [\n]. But in the earlier learning stages, the clinician must use rigorous conscious logic and pattern recognition to laboriously conclude the diagnosis [\n]. Hence, an emphasis by educators should be to provide clear and detailed explanations of the known logic rules and the patterns of both pathological and clinical elements associated with each specific state of health and disease. The student will then have some rational framework with which to consciously translate the external signs and symptoms into internal diagnoses of pathosis [\n]. Experienced clinical educators who can not deconstruct their own unconscious competence into defined conscious and rational statements will not optimize their students’ learning. The art of diagnosis needs to be transformed into an explicit and explainable science to be readily teachable to inexperienced operators [\nClinical diagnostic adages\nNo account of the clinical diagnostic process would be complete without mentioning some clinical adages that are in common use.\nFirst, it has been said that “one’s ears are the best diagnostic tool,” with evidence from a patient’s history often trumping complex and expensive special investigations [\n]. More emphasis on the clinical history and examination is helpful before special investigations are requested.\nSecond, any reported symptoms should be confirmed with a related clinical sign. Reproducing the symptom with an associated clinical sign confirms the validity of the history.\nThird, another useful concept is, where appropriate, to try to deduce an individual diagnosis for each tissue, process, or body part under investigation. This more detailed diagnosis by individual sites can lead to a more precisely tailored treatment plan. Each of these tissues or body parts may need specific but different management at different time stages.\nFourth, the adage that “common things are common” reminds us of the greater probability of a routine condition compared with an extraordinarily rare disease, notwithstanding the need to discount rare conditions.\nFinally, when a diagnosis is still in doubt, in all but the most extreme circumstances, it is critical that harmful intervention is not provided until a dependable diagnosis is obtained. Repetition of the diagnostic process, additional investigations, further opinions from colleagues, or just allowing more time may lead to a clear diagnosis.\nPrimum non nocere\nConclusions\nIn summary, misdiagnoses in healthcare are common and cause much harm and cost. The diagnostic method uses two fundamental reasoning techniques: individual or multiple logic statements, and pattern recognition of failing disease elements. Many elements are out of view of the clinician who must reverse translate the external signs and symptoms into internal diseased elements to deduce the internal diagnosis. While experienced clinicians may be able to do much of this reasoning subconsciously, inexperienced clinicians must consciously deliberate each logic step and pattern. Although observation of clinical cases is a valuable learning exercise, clinical teachers will accelerate their students’ learning by providing the deconstructed reasoning behind each diagnosis. The aim here is to better rationalize the diagnostic process, to allow it to be better taught, and to allow clinicians to become better diagnosticians. Without knowing disease from health, or one disease from another, reliable design and delivery of therapy are not possible. It is sobering to realize that someone over 300 years ago knew this when they coined the word “diagnosis” to “know apart.”\nThe content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

The definitions and illustrative examples provided here will be useful for developers of diagnostic expert systems.\nDescription of the Problem\nRepresenting medical knowledge is a highly complex endeavor. The improper use of the terms “syndrome”, “disease” and their relations to “diagnosis” is one of the difficulties with which medical informaticians must deal, especially when developing expert systems to support diagnoses. Although ubiquitous in medical and lay discourse, the term “disease” has no unambiguous, generally accepted definition. However, most of those using this term allow themselves the comfortable delusion that everyone knows what it means.\nOnly sparse and fragmented literature could be found regarding this issue.\nPurpose\nThe different concepts about “what types of conditions may be said to constitute a disease” will be discussed. The “unorthodox” ways in which terms “disease” and “syndrome” are being used, as well as their different interrelationships, will be shown.\nIllustrative cases will be used to present potentially ambiguous situations found when representing medical knowledge in expert systems.\nThe “Disease Entity” Assumption\nDiagnostic categories (diseases and most syndromes) are simply concepts. They are justified only if they provide a useful framework for organizing and explaining the complexity of clinical experience in order to derive inferences about outcome and if they guide decisions about treatment.\nsyndrome\nis a recognizable complex of symptoms and physical findings which indicate a specific condition for which a direct cause is not necessarily understood. Thus in practice doctors refer to the infamous “viral syndrome” as such because of the uncertainty regarding the legion of viral agents that is causing the illness. Once medical science identifies a causative agent or process with a fairly high degree of certainty, physicians may then refer to the process as a\ndisease\n, not a syndrome. Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome became Kawasaki syndrome which in turn metamorphosed into Kawasaki disease; the latter is properly a disease, no longer a syndrome, by virtue of its clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.\nAlbert\net al.\ncatalogued six general views or concepts about what types of conditions may be said to constitute a disease. These views range from nominalism and cultural-relativistic theories (i.e. some conditions become a disease when a profession or a society labels it as such) to a “disease realism” view (objectively demonstrable departure from adaptive biological functioning). The latter model is the one best suited to the present state of medicine; it emphasizes that the clinical signs and symptoms do not constitute the disease and that it is not until causal mechanisms are clearly identified that we can say we have “really” discovered the disease.\nMedical literature, even that from governmental organizations and institutions authorized to implement standards, is plagued with misleading assertions such as “a syndrome is a disease …”, “a syndrome indicates a particular disease…” and “Lyme disease syndrome” (It is inappropriate to apply “syndrome” to Lyme disease because its causative agent is known).\nSome syndromes such as “heart failure” are useful medical concepts but are not diagnoses, whereas more specific syndromes such as “congestive heart failure” or “right heart failure” are diagnoses\n. Due to the imprecision of natural language, some syndromes could also imply a simple pathological finding (vasculitis) or just a physical finding. Frequently, for example, arthritis syndromes are simply referred to as “arthritis”.\nReferences\nAlbert DA, Munson R, Resnik MD: Reasoning in Medicine.

However, the diagnostic accuracy of the numbers of symptoms has not been well studied. This study aims to use equations and simulations to demonstrate how the factors that determine symptom incidence influence symptoms’ diagnostic accuracy for disease diagnosis. Assuming a disease causing symptoms and correlated with the other disease in 10,000 simulated subjects, 40 symptoms occurred based on 3 epidemiological measures: proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence (among those not diseased), and risk ratios. Symptoms occurred with similar correlation coefficients. The sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis were exhibited as equations using the three epidemiological measures and approximated using linear regression in simulated populations. The areas under curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was the measure to determine the diagnostic accuracy of multiple symptoms, derived by using 2 to 40 symptoms for disease diagnosis. With respect to each AUC, the best set of sensitivity and specificity, whose difference with 1 in the absolute value was maximal, was chosen. The results showed sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis were fully explained with the three epidemiological measures in simulated subjects. The AUCs increased or decreased with more symptoms used for disease diagnosis, when the risk ratios were greater or less than 1, respectively. Based on the AUCs, with risk ratios were similar to 1, symptoms did not provide diagnostic values. When risk ratios were greater or less than 1, maximal or minimal AUCs usually could be reached with less than 30 symptoms. The maximal AUCs and their best sets of sensitivities and specificities could be well approximated with the three epidemiological and interaction terms, adjusted R-squared ≥ 0.69. However, the observed overall symptom correlations, overall symptom incidence, and numbers of symptoms explained a small fraction of the AUC variances, adjusted R-squared ≤ 0.03. In conclusion, the sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis can be explained fully by the at-risk incidence and the 1 minus baseline incidence, respectively. The epidemiological measures and baseline symptom correlations can explain large fractions of the variances of the maximal AUCs and the best sets of sensitivities and specificities. These findings are important for researchers who want to assess the diagnostic accuracy of composite diagnostic criteria.\nSubject terms:\nEpidemiology, Computational models, Epidemiology, Population screening\nIntroduction\nSymptoms that are considered signs of certain diseases have been used for diagnostic purposes such as those used for the diagnosis of frailty and mental illnesses\n. The diagnostic accuracy of these symptoms varies over a wide range\n. The number of symptoms used to diagnose varies across diagnoses\nand even for the same diagnosis\n. For example,\nfrailty\n, a geriatric syndrome, has been defined and diagnosed with 4 to 70 symptoms, depending on the frailty models\n. More complicated frailty models define and use more frailty symptoms for diagnosis\n. Since various designs and model specifications coexist, it remains unclear whether there are optimal numbers of symptoms for the diagnosis of a disease, for example, frailty.\nIn a simplistic hypothetical case (see Table\n), a proportion of a population is affected by a disease, denoted by\n, and a constant and random rate of incidence occurs for one symptom at a particular time point, denoted by\n. For those affected by the disease, the incidence rate of the symptoms increases by a risk ratio, denoted by\n. With respect to the individuals diseased, the proportion of those presenting the symptom was\nrr,\nand the proportion of those not presenting the symptom was\n(1 − ir\nrr)\n. Regarding those not diseased, the proportion of those presenting the symptom was\n(1 − d)\nand the proportion of those not presenting the symptom was\n(1 − d)\n(1 − ir)\n. The sensitivity\nof this symptom for detecting the disease equaled\nrr)/d\n, and the specificity was\n[(1 − d)\n(1 − ir)]/(1 − d)\n1 − ir\n. Based on these calculations, the symptom incidence (and the risk ratio) should connect to the diagnostic test accuracy of the symptoms for the disease.\nTable 1.\nDiagnostic accuracy of a single symptom to diagnose the disease cause in equations.\nDisease status\nDisease present\nDisease absent\nProportions diseased\nSymptom present\nSymptom absent\nDerived statistics if the symptom present\nSensitivity\nSpecificity\nPositive predictive value\nNegative predictive value\nObserved ratios of developing symptoms\nDerived statistics if the incidence reaching 1 among those diseased (\nSensitivity\nSpecificity\nPositive predictive value\nNegative predictive value\n= 1\nObserved ratios of developing symptoms\nOpen in a new tab\nEquations are derived based on Baratloo et al.’s definitions\nproportions in a population with the disease,\nsymptom incidence rate,\nrisk ratios.\nIn Table\n, a two-symptom case is hypothesized. Two symptoms are associated with the occurrence of the disease. There are incidence rates and risk ratios for presenting both symptoms, one, or none. The correlations between the symptoms can influence the co-occurrence of multiple symptoms and thus joint incidence (\nboth\n) and joint risk ratios (\nboth\n. The sensitivity and specificity\nof presenting two symptoms for the detection of the disease are\nboth\nboth\nand\n1 − ir\nboth\nrespectively. The sensitivity and specificity\nof presenting one of the symptoms for the detection of the disease are\none\none\nand\n1 − ir\none\n, respectively. When increasing numbers of symptoms present due to the disease status, it becomes more difficult to predict the relationship between the disease status and the symptoms using equations.\nTable 2.\nDiagnostic accuracy of two symptoms to diagnose the disease cause in equations.\nDisease status\nDisease present\nDisease absent\nProbability\n1 − d\nBoth symptoms present\nboth\nboth\n1 − d\n) ×\nboth\nAt least one symptoms present\none\none\n1 − d\n) ×\none\nBoth symptoms absent\n× (\nboth\nboth\n1 − d\n)× (\nboth\nAt least one symptom absent\n× (\none\none\n1 − d\n)× (\none\nDerived statistics if both symptoms present\nSensitivity\nboth\nboth\nboth\nboth\nSpecificity\n1 − d\n) × (\nboth\n)]/(\n1 − d\n) =\nboth\nPositive predictive value\nboth\nboth\n)/[\nboth\nboth\n+ (\n1 − d\n) ×\nboth\n] = (\nboth\nboth\n)/(\nboth\nboth\nboth\nboth\nNegative predictive value\n1 − d\n) × (\nboth\n)/[\n× (\nboth\nboth\n) + (\n1 − d\n) × (\nboth\n)] = (\n1 − d\nboth\nboth\n)/(\n1 − d\nboth\nboth\nboth\nboth\nDerived risk ratios of developing 2 symptoms\nboth\nboth\n+ (\n1 − d\n) ×\nboth\n]/[\n× (\nboth\nboth\n) + (\n1 − d\n) × (\nboth\n)] = (\nboth\nboth\nboth\nboth\n)/ (\n1 − d\nboth\nboth\nboth\nboth\nDerived statistics if at least one symptom present\nSensitivity\none\none\none\none\nSpecificity\n1 − d\n) × (\none\n)]/(\n1 − d\n) =\none\nPositive predictive value\none\none\n)/[\none\none\n+ (\n1 − d\n) ×\none\n] = (\none\none\n)/ (\none\none\none\none\nNegative predictive value\n1 − d\n) × (\none\n)/[\none\none\n) + (\n1 − d\n) × (\none\n)] = (\n1 − d\none\none\n)/(\n1 − d\none\none\none\none\nOpen in a new tab\nEquations are derived based on Baratloo et al.’s definitions\nboth\nboth symptoms presenting due to the disease that caused the symptoms,\nproportions in a population with the disease,\nsymptom incidence rate,\none\none symptom presenting,\nrisk ratios.\nThis study aims to understand the relationships between disease statuses and associated symptoms in terms of their diagnostic test accuracy by simulating populations of various assumed disease prevalence, symptom incidence, risk ratios, and correlations between symptoms.\nMethods\nThe assumptions and the epidemiological measures for the simulations are listed in Table\nand illustrated in Fig.\n. In detail, there were only two diseases. One directly influenced the incidence of the symptoms, and the other was only associated with the disease. The incidence rates and risk ratios were similar with respect to all the simulated symptoms. The products of the incidence rates and risk ratios (at-risk incidence) could not exceed 1, an upper limit of incidence rate of 100%. There were 10,000 individuals simulated each time. There were 40 symptoms induced by the disease. The correlations between the disease and the other associated disease were 0, 0.3, and 0.7. We assumed the prevalence rates of the disease were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8, similar to the values adopted in a previous study\n. Several conditions have been observed in more than 80% of selected populations, for example, Epstein–Barr virus infection\nand the herpes simplex virus type 2 infection\n. The baseline incidence of developing symptoms for those not affected by the disease were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8. The risk ratios of developing symptoms when diseased were 0.5 (less likely to develop symptoms), 1.0 (equally likely to develop symptoms), 2, 5, 10, and 25 (more likely to develop symptoms). Risk ratios more than 25 were reported in several studies\n. We assumed the correlations between the symptoms were 0, 0.4, and 0.8, similar to a range in a previous study\n. We assumed the correlations between the diseases were 0, 0.3, and 0.7. We used 10 simulations for each combination of disease correlations, disease prevalence, symptom incidence, symptom correlations, and risk ratios of developing symptoms.\nTable 3.\nAssumptions and the assessments of the simulated symptoms.\nAssumptions\n2 diseases of interest: one disease directly related to the symptoms and the other associated with the disease only (unrelated to symptoms)\nSimilar baseline incidence rates among those not diseased and similar risk ratios for the symptoms\nAccurate disease statuses; symptoms reported accurately by patients\nThe products of baseline incidence rates and risk ratios less than or equal to 1\nSimilar baseline correlations between symptoms among those diseased or not diseased\nEpidemiological measures of symptom occurrence in simulations\nPopulation sizes\n10,000\nNumber of symptoms that can be caused by the disease\nCorrelations between the disease that caused symptoms and the other associated disease that did not cause symptoms\n0, 0.3, and 0.7\nPrevalence rates or proportions of the population with the disease that caused symptoms\n0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8\nBaseline incidence rates of the symptoms, similar to all symptoms\n0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8\nRisk ratios of developing symptoms if diseased\n0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, and 25.0\nCorrelations between symptoms\n0, 0.4, and 0.8\nNumber of simulations for each combination of the above measures 3 to 7\nStatistics for assessment\nCorrelations between symptoms\nDiagnostic test accuracy (sensitivities, specificities, and AUCs) of the symptoms for the detection of the disease\nDiagnostic test accuracy (sensitivities, specificities, and AUCs) of the symptoms for the detection of the unrelated disease\nOpen in a new tab\nAUC\narea under curve.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nElements of the simulations in this study.\nproportions diseased,\nincidence rate,\nrisk ratio.\nSimulation procedures\nThe R codes to simulate individuals with assumed epidemiological measures are in Appendix\n. For each simulation, we chose a combination of the above-mentioned epidemiological measures, including disease incidence, associations between diseases, and symptom risk ratios. In a simulation, we created 10,000 individuals and randomly assigned them disease statuses based on the assumed proportions diseased. We also randomly assigned the other associated disease based on its correlations with the main disease using an established method\n. The probability of individuals developing symptoms differed by whether they were diseased or not. Among those diseased, the probability of developing a symptom was the product of its baseline incidence and an assumed risk ratio. Among those not diseased, the probability of developing a symptom was based on the baseline incidence of the symptom, and we created 40 symptoms at the same time. We considered the correlations between the 40 symptoms, and we randomly assigned the symptoms based on disease statuses\nDiagnostic test accuracy of symptoms\nWe first described the diagnostic accuracy of the symptoms to detect the disease and the other associated disease using equations. Then we used the data obtained from simulations to validate the equations. We defined\nsensitivity\nas the number of true cases identified by a symptom or symptoms (more than the numbers required by a threshold) divided by the number of those diseased\n. We defined\nspecificity\nas the number of non-cases identified by the absence of a symptom or symptoms (using the same threshold as the sensitivity) divided by the number of those not diseased. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the 95% CIs were derived when using more than one symptom to detect the disease status\n. We compared the area under curves (AUCs) that were derived from using different numbers of symptoms for disease diagnosis\n. We chose the best set of sensitivity and specificity in a ROC curve by searching the set with the maximal difference between 1 and the sum of sensitivity and specificity in absolute values\n. We reported the number of symptoms and the sensitivity and specificity of the best set.\nApproximation of diagnostic accuracy and symptom correlations\nWe approximated the correlations between symptoms and diagnostic accuracy, including the sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis in simulated populations, with epidemiological measures using linear regression. Using linear regression models to approximate complicated measures has been proven to be an effective method to understand the role or importance of various factors on these measures. We considered correlations between symptoms or diagnostic accuracy to be a dependent variable (\n), and approximated them by using the above-mentioned epidemiological measures with or without their interaction terms (denoted as\nranging from 1 to the total number of independent variables in a regression model). The equation was\n, where\ndenoted the intercept,\ndenoted the regression coefficients, and\nwas the number of independent variables. The implementation of the regression models is available in the R codes in Appendix\nWe used this approach to interpret principal components\n, determine life stages\n, interpret the diagnosis of frailty syndrome\n, and demonstrate the biases generated by the diagnostic criteria of mental illnesses\n. We conduced all the statistical analyses using the R environment (v3.5.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)\nand RStudio (v1.1.463, RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA)\nResults\nQuality of simulations and symptom incidence\nThe derived baseline incidence rates of single symptoms matched the assumed incidence rates, regardless of the assumed proportions diseased, assumed risk ratios, and assumed correlations between symptoms (Appendix\n). The derived risk ratios matched the assumed risk ratios when the at-risk incidence (incidence among those diseased) was less than 1 (Appendix\n). Figure\npresents the symptom incidence among all subjects. The overall symptom incidence depended on the proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence, and symptom risk ratios. Based on the similarities between the assumed and derived values, the simulations were well implemented.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nSymptom incidence depending on the baseline incidence, proportions diseased, and risk ratios.\nrisk ratios.\nCorrelations between symptoms\nThe correlations between the symptoms ranged from − 0.02 to 0.99 in all simulations (see Table\n). The effects of the assumed epidemiological measures on the correlations between symptoms in the linear regression models depended on whether the at-risk incidence reached 1. The correlations between the two diseases, one causing symptoms and the other only associated with the disease, were not significantly associated with the correlations between the symptoms. The at-risk incidence reaching 1 or not, proportions diseased, risk ratios, at-risk incidence, and symptom correlations among those not diseased (baseline symptom correlations) were significantly and positively associated with the overall symptom correlations. The baseline incidence was negatively and significantly associated with the overall symptom correlations. The adjusted R-squared was 0.86 and 0.89 with at-risk incidence reaching 1 or not, respectively.\nTable 4.\nEffects of baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on overall symptom correlations.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n− 0.007\n(− 0.008 to − 0.006)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(− 0.001 to 0.001)\n0.859\nProportions diseased\n0.119\n(0.117 to 0.121)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline incidence\n− 0.107\n(− 0.109 to − 0.105)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n0.016\n(0.016 to 0.016)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n0.185\n(0.183 to 0.187)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n0.841\n(0.840 to 0.842)\n< 0.0001\nDependent variables mean = 0.5; SD = 0.31; median = 0.47; min = − 0.04; max = 0.99\nAdjusted R-square = 0.89\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n0.339\n(0.336 to 0.342)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(− 0.002 to 0.002)\n0.736\nProportions diseased\n0.315\n(0.312 to 0.318)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline incidence\n− 0.337\n(− 0.341 to − 0.333)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n0.01\n(0.01 to 0.01)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n0.639\n(0.637 to 0.641)\n< 0.0001\nDependent variables mean = 0.62; SD = 0.29; median = 0.72; min = − 0.02; max = 0.99\nAdjusted R-square = 0.86\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nDiagnostic test accuracy of individual symptoms for the detection of the diseases\nAs expected in Table\n, the sensitivities and specificities of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis can be predicted with at-risk incidence (Table\n) and 1 minus baseline incidence (Table\n), respectively. The sensitivities of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis were 1 for all symptoms, when the at-risk incidence reached 1. The effect sizes of disease correlations, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations remained the same, when the at-risk incidence reached 1 or not.\nTable 5.\nEffects of baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on the sensitivities of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\n0.82\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\n0.03\nBaseline incidence\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\n0.22\nDependent variable mean = 0.64; SD = 0.32; median = 0.55; min = 0.12; max = 1\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\n0.24\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\n0.34\nBaseline incidence\n(0 to 0)\n0.22\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n0.71\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\n0.22\nDependent variable mean = 1; SD = 0; median = 1; min = 1; max = 1\nAdjusted R-square = 0.5\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nTable 6.\nEffects of baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on the specificities of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\n0.03\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\n0.01\nBaseline incidence\n− 1\n(− 1 to − 1)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\n0.1\nDependent variable mean = 0.62; SD = 0.27; median = 0.61; min = 0.17; max = 0.97\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\n0.95\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\n0.24\nBaseline incidence\n− 1\n(− 1 to − 1)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\n0.97\nDependent variable mean = 0.61; SD = 0.29; median = 0.63; min = 0.17; max = 0.97\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nDiagnostic test accuracy of symptom numbers for disease diagnosis\nWhen using the accumulative numbers of symptoms to predict the disease directly causing the symptoms, we used the AUCs to compare the diagnostic test accuracy across the numbers of symptoms used. Figure\nshows one example of the ROC curve assuming the risk ratio as 2, baseline symptom incidence as 0.1, proportions diseased as 0.05, no correlations between diseases, and no correlations between symptoms. When more symptoms were used for disease diagnosis, the AUCs increased. We selected the best set of sensitivities and specificities for disease diagnosis based on the sums of sensitivities and specificities (red dots in Fig.\n). The red dots also represent the diagnostic thresholds for disease diagnosis. For example, when using 40 symptoms for disease diagnosis, the threshold of obtaining the best set of sensitivities and specificities was 5.5 (see the red dots in Fig.\n). This result suggested that when there were 6 or more symptoms out of 40 presenting in individual patients, the sensitivity to detect the disease cause was 86.3%. The specificity for correctly excluding the disease in individuals with less than 6 symptoms out of 40 was 79.4%. For other combinations of epidemiologic measures, see examples in Appendix\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for disease diagnosis based on the numbers of symptoms. Red dots = the set of sensitivities and specificities with the largest difference in the absolute values between 1 and the sums of sensitivities and specificities in a ROC curve. For each number of symptoms used for disease diagnosis, one red dot—a best set of sensitivities and specificities—was selected. With a maximum of 40 symptoms used for disease diagnosis, ROC curves in this figure were created assuming the risk ratio as 2, baseline symptom incidence as 0.1, proportions diseased as 0.05, no correlations between diseases, and no correlations between symptoms.\nTable\nshows the effects of epidemiological measures on the AUCs of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis. The AUCs of individual symptoms can be explained fully by disease correlations, proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence, risk ratios, at-risk symptom incidence, and symptom correlations (adjusted R-squared = 1 for at-risk incidence reaching 1 or not). When the at-risk incidence was less than 1, the at-risk incidence and baseline incidence had the same effect sizes of opposite directions, a regression coefficient of 0.5 and − 0.5, respectively. When the at-risk incidence reached 1, the AUCs of individual symptoms decreased with the baseline symptom incidence (regression coefficient = − 0.5) from 1 (perfect diagnostic accuracy).\nTable 7.\nEffects of baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n0.5\n(0.5 to 0.5)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\n0.25\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\n0.57\nBaseline incidence\n− 0.5\n(− 0.5 to − 0.5)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n0.5\n(0.5 to 0.5)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\n0.44\nDependent variable mean = 0.63; SD = 0.27; median = 0.6; min = 0.27; max = 0.98\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\n0.21\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\n0.37\nBaseline incidence\n− 0.5\n(− 0.5 to − 0.5)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\n0.06\nDependent variable mean = 0.8; SD = 0.15; median = 0.8; min = 0.59; max = 0.98\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nIn Table\n, using a maximum of 40 symptoms for disease diagnosis, we analyzed the effects of the epidemiological measures on the observed maximal AUCs. The effect sizes and statistical significance of the epidemiologic measures depended on whether the at-risk incidence reached 1. The correlations between diseases were not significant (\n> 0.68 for both). Proportions diseased were significantly and positively associated with the maximal AUCs (\n< 0.05 for all). Baseline symptom incidence and symptom correlations were significantly and negatively associated with the maximal AUCs (\n< 0.05 for all).

When single symptoms are caused by a common disease and used to predict disease status, the sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms can be predicted fully with the at-risk incidence and 1 minus baseline symptom incidence, respectively. This can be proved by mathematical equations or observed in simulations. However, when two or more symptoms of the same disease cause are used to estimate disease status, the estimates of the joint incidence rates, joint risk ratios, and joint at-risk incidence are required in the equations describing these multiple symptoms. Therefore, it becomes complicated to derive diagnostic accuracy in mathematical equations, and so it is practical to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of multiple symptoms through simulations. Key epidemiological measures for symptom development were identified in the equations: proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence, and risk ratios of symptom development. The correlations between symptoms are important when more than one symptom are used for disease diagnosis. A combination of these epidemiological measures of the symptoms can be used to simulate symptom development according to disease status. When at most two symptoms occur in a population, the diagnostic accuracy—sensitivities and specificities—of having 0, 1, and 2 symptoms can be derived to construct a ROC and its AUC. By repeating this process until 40 symptoms are used, the AUCs increase or decrease or remain around 0.5 when risk ratios are greater than 1, less than 1, or equals 1, respectively. For a combination of the epidemiological measures, the maximal AUCs can be selected from the simulations. We selected the best sets of sensitivities and specificities whose absolute values had the largest differences between their sums and 1, for a given AUC. The trade-off between sensitivities and specificities can be observed\n, when more symptoms are used for disease diagnosis.\nFor a combination of epidemiological measures, AUCs tend to reach the plateau with less than 30 symptoms, particularly when baseline symptom correlations are closer to 0, i.e., symptoms are not statistically correlated. The maximal AUCs can be well approximated with baseline incidence, risk ratios, at-risk incidence, and baseline symptom correlations (adjusted R-squared > 0.71). The best sets of sensitivities and specificities also can be well approximated with these measures (adjusted R-squared > 0.69). However, in the real world, symptom incidence and risk ratios cannot be determined when the disease status cannot be precisely confirmed. We found that the three observable measures—overall symptom correlations, overall symptom incidence, and numbers of symptoms—do not well explain the AUC variances (adjusted R-squared = 0.03). When researchers are confident that the RRs are greater than 1 (AUCs increase with the numbers of symptoms), the observable measures explain the AUC variances even worse (adjusted R-squared = 0.02).\nEvidence-based recommendations?\nA previous study has provided several recommendations for how to use age-related symptoms to diagnose a geriatric syndrome, frailty\n. The first recommendation for using symptoms for frailty diagnosis was to explicitly select these symptoms based on their associations with health status\n. The authors did not provide recommendations about selecting symptoms directly associated with frailty\n. The second recommendation was to choose symptoms that become more prevalent with age\n. The third recommendation was to choose symptoms that do not saturate early in the life stage (do not become very prevalent among the elderly)\n. The fourth recommendation was to include symptoms developed from different systems\n, for example, not to include only symptoms related to changes in cognition\n. The last recommendation was to use the same frailty indices consisting of the same symptoms, when the indices are used in the same populations in different time points\n. The authors thought different frailty indices often yield similar results in the same samples\nOne additional recommendation was to use at least 30 to 40 symptoms to create frailty indices, since they claimed that using more symptoms leads to more precise estimates\nNo scientific evidence exists to support the first three above-mentioned recommendations\n. In fact, these three recommendations are likely to contradict our findings. When symptoms were used to predict a disease not directly associated with them in our simulations, the diagnostic accuracy of the symptoms for the associated disease partly depended on the correlations between the associated disease and the disease that directly caused symptoms (Table\n). When health-related symptoms are chosen based on health status and used to predict frailty, the correlations between health status and frailty should be well determined to understand their role in the diagnostic accuracy of the health-related symptoms for frailty. The first recommendation failed to recognize that the diagnostic accuracy of the health-related symptoms for frailty diagnosis depends on the correlations between health status and frailty and their interaction terms with baseline symptom incidence, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations.\nThe second and third recommendations require the symptoms to also be associated with age\n. In addition to being caused by frailty in theory, the symptoms used to predict frailty are required to be associated with both health status and age. This approach creates a causal network that is difficult to simulate due to the large number of epidemiological measures involved, including the associations between age, health status, and frailty (3 parameters), how they interact with the baseline incidence and risk ratios of symptoms (3 X 2 parameters), and many others. This complexity is beyond what our simulations could handle and thus further evidence to justify these recommendations would be required. However, to our knowledge, no clear evidence exists to support the hypothesized casual network associated with these two recommendations.\nThe second and third recommendations also impose limits on the prevalence of the symptoms for frailty diagnosis\n. The prevalence of frailty symptoms could not be too low because they need to increase with age according to the second recommendation\n. Frailty symptoms could not be too common so that they would not saturate early\n. In our simulations, overall symptom incidence failed to explain a large proportion of AUC variances, and was, in fact, negatively associated with diagnostic accuracy, AUCs. When baseline symptom incidence (among those not diseased only) can be estimated, it is negatively associated with the specificities of individual symptoms. We do not have sufficient evidence to support the recommendations to select frailty symptoms based on overall symptom prevalence.\nOur findings partly address the fourth recommendation that encourages using symptoms from various human systems. Baseline symptom correlations (among those not diseased) are significantly and negatively associated with the maximal AUCs, when the at-risk incidence among those diseased reached 1 or not. This recommendation may make better sense, particularly when symptoms from various human systems are less correlated. In the simulations, overall symptom correlations that are observable are significantly and positively associated with AUCs, though slightly. It is unclear whether the ranges of correlations that the recommendation authors aimed to suggest and this recommendation can be improved based on our findings.\nThe additional recommendation that encourages using more symptoms (at least 30) for disease diagnosis is not supported by any evidence\n. Our simulations show that diagnostic accuracy measured with AUCs often reaches a plateau at 30 or fewer symptoms. Moreover, the frailty indices produced by the authors of the recommendations being discussed have been criticized for using an excessive number of symptoms\n. Their frailty indices seem overcomplicated and can be simplified with fewer symptoms, because many of the input symptoms are correlated\nImplications for the use of diagnostic criteria\nCurrently the diagnosis of many conditions, such as mental illnesses\nand frailty indices\n, are based on composite diagnostic criteria. Both mental illnesses and frailty indices use symptoms to confirm diagnoses\n. However, recently several issues related to composite diagnostic criteria have been identified. The most important issue is that complicated diagnostic criteria introduce biases into the diagnoses\n. The input symptoms often are summed and censored with certain thresholds to derive intermediate variables or confirm diagnoses\n. When the numbers or sum of symptoms are censored, biases that are not explained by the input symptoms can be generated and introduced to the diagnoses\n. Therefore, the diagnoses of frailty have poor relationships with the input symptoms and do not predict major outcomes better than their input symptoms\n. When tested in trials, the use of the diagnoses of poor interpretability, such as frailty, is associated with early termination of trials\nBased on the findings in the present study, several approaches can be used to improve current diagnostic strategies. First, under certain circumstances, single symptoms may achieve high sensitivity or specificity. To effectively detect the disease, single symptoms need to be rare among those not diseased (a low baseline incidence and thus a high specificity) and have high risk ratios of development due to the disease cause (high sensitivity). However, the baseline incidence and risk ratios of the symptoms used to diagnose several conditions, such as frailty\nor mental illnesses\n, have not been well demonstrated.\nSecond, symptoms should be selected based on evidence, at least on the understanding of possible causes of the symptoms, estimated risk ratios, baseline symptom incidence, and baseline symptom correlations. We noticed that when the risk ratios were similar to 1, the maximal AUCs were around 0.5, and so the AUCs provided little diagnostic values. When the risk ratios were less than 1, suggesting that the presenting symptoms were less likely to be related to the disease, the AUCs were likely to be less than 0.5. When the risk ratios were greater than 1, the AUCs tended to exceed 0.5. When using less than 30 symptoms for disease diagnosis, the AUCs can often reach plateau levels. Epidemiological measures have different impacts on the sensitivities and specificities obtained from the maximal or minimal AUCs using at most 40 symptoms, and assuming risk ratios greater or less than 1, respectively.\nThird, when the relationships between symptoms have been well explored, using the number of symptoms for disease diagnosis can effectively minimize the biases introduced by data censoring\n. The biases induced by data censoring or categorization can lead to a diagnosis, of which more than 70% of its variances can be explained by biases alone\nFourth, using more symptoms for diagnosis increases complexity. In the present study, when we used more symptoms for diagnosis, we found that their diagnostic accuracy could be improved according to AUCs. However, selecting single symptoms with a high diagnostic accuracy is much preferred because using multiple symptoms requires complex design, depends on well-tested thresholds, and needs to be justified with extensive research on these symptoms and their interactions.\nFifth, baseline symptom correlations are associated with the diagnostic accuracy (AUC) plateau that the symptoms can reach. The differences in the diagnostic accuracy of single symptoms and multiple symptoms are larger when the baseline symptom correlations are closer to 0. It is highly recommended that diagnoses consider the correlations between the symptoms among those diseased or not. Last, in the real world, when the disease cause remains to be investigated, it is not likely to achieve a perfect estimate of baseline symptom incidence or risk ratios, or to confirm baseline symptom correlations among those not diseased. In our simulations, overall symptom correlations, overall symptom incidence, and numbers of symptoms were observable and can be easily obtained. If the risk ratios cannot be estimated at all, symptom correlations and numbers of symptoms are positively and significantly associated with the AUCs for disease diagnosis. The overall symptom incidence is negatively and significantly associated with the AUCs. The three observable measures only explain a small fraction of the variances of the AUCs for disease diagnosis (adjusted R-squared = 0.03). When researchers are confident that these symptoms are more likely to occur among those diseased (RR > 1), these three measures remain significant, although the fraction of the variances of the AUCs for disease diagnosis further decreases (adjusted R-squared = 0.02).\nFuture research directions\nSeveral directions are open for future research. First, continuous variables can be used for disease diagnosis, which will require the development of complicated mathematical equations and add complexity to simulation and modeling. We will use the number of symptoms as the template for continuous-variable simulations. Second, often, more than one disease can cause the same symptoms, which adds quite a few interaction terms to the epidemiological measures. When established, these models will provide valuable examples to real-world studies. Third, models that build on incremental improvement will be necessary. It is computationally impossible to implement all models to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of the symptoms that occurred based on the epidemiological measures of all possible values. However, it is relatively feasible to construct simulations that conform to well-studied association networks\nand epidemiological measures reasonably estimated with real-world data. Simulations can be used to support the findings from real world data, and may provide lessons for causal inference. In future studies, we will implement more complicated simulations and explore the usefulness of simulations for causal inference.\nLastly, situations exist that involve more complicated diagnostic approaches, for example clinical case definitions used in outbreak investigations\n. Case definitions may be applicable to patients experiencing symptoms or signs in certain times or places, depending on the diseases of interest\n. For example, a clinical malaria case can be defined based on the presence of the pathogen in the blood and the occurrence of related symptoms within 2 days of examination\n. These case definitions can be modified to suit outbreak investigations and settings\n. Our findings help to demonstrate the key epidemiological parameters that researchers need to pay attention to when they aim to update case definitions. In an outbreak investigation, the information on these epidemiological measures should be systematically collected. We think it possible to improve case definitions using updated information on these measures. This finding needs to be studied further in the future.\nLimitations\nOur simulation study depended on various assumptions: one disease causing multiple symptoms, similar symptom incidence, similar risk ratios causing symptoms, and similar correlations between symptoms among those not diseased. A related disease was set up to occur in association with the symptom-causing disease. This related disease remains insignificant in the symptoms’ diagnostic accuracy for disease diagnosis (AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities). However, the simulations are not likely to match the complex multi-cause examples commonly seen in the real world. For example, the symptoms of frailty, a geriatric syndrome, can be linked to frailty and many other causes\n. Due to computational constraints, a limited number of the values of the epidemiological measures were simulated. These epidemiological measures have many other values that need to be tested. Assuming the epidemiological measures have similar levels across symptoms, variations are due to the random assignment to different simulated populations. These variations may lead to slight differences in the simulation results.\nConclusion\nAssuming symptoms are caused by a single disease, they occur based on four epidemiological measures: proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations. The symptom incidence among those diseased, at-risk incidence, can reach a maximum of 1. The sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis can be fully predicted by at-risk incidence and 1 minus baseline incidence, respectively. When the disease causes multiple symptoms based on similar epidemiological measures, these symptoms can be used for disease diagnosis. Using two symptoms for disease diagnosis—for example, the sensitivities and specificities of having 0, 1, or 2 symptoms—can be calculated to draw a ROC and derive its AUC. When repeating the same procedures using 1 to 40 symptoms for disease diagnosis, the maximal AUCs can be obtained, and the best sets of sensitivities and specificities can be selected from them. The above-mentioned epidemiological measures can explain large fractions of the maximal AUCs and the best sets of sensitivities and specificities. These findings are important for researchers who want to assess composite diagnostic criteria that are subject to biases and lack an evidence base. For example, the recommendations on constructing a frailty index have been widely used\n. However, these recommendations neglect the role of these epidemiological measures and focus on observable measures (overall symptom incidence and numbers of symptoms) that do not well explain symptom diagnostic accuracy.\nSupplementary Information\nSupplementary Information.\n(2.7MB, docx)\nAuthor contributions\nY.S.C. conceptualized and designed this study, managed and analyzed data, and drafted the manuscript.

(Vrikshayurveda). Medicinal Plants form the \nmajor resource base of our indigenous healthcare traditions. Although in recent years cultivation of \nmedicinal plants has started gaining momentum, still a significant part of our requirements continue \nto be met from wild sources. In order to meet increasing demand for medicinal plants both domestic \nand from overseas markets we need to focus on both ex-situ cultivation of medicinal plants as well \nas in-situ conservation efforts through systematic surveys, augmenting local medicinal plants and \naromatic species of medicinal significance through afforestation as per silvicultural principles and \nmanagement prescriptions. With this in mind the “Central Sector Scheme for Conservation, \nDevelopment and Sustainable Management of Medicinal Plants” was initially approved by the \ncabinet vide no. CCEA/21/2008 dated 26.06.2008. The scheme was approved with an outlay of Rs. \n450.00 crores for XIIth Plan period in the EFC meeting held on 01-12-2014 and continued till \n31stMarch, 2021. The Central Sector Scheme for Conservation, Development and Sustainable \nManagement of Medicinal Plants has been further approved for continuation beyond 31st March, \n2021 with an outlay of Rs. 322.41 Crores for a period of five years from 2021-22 to 2025-26 in \nthe SFC meeting held on 17th March, 2021 \n\nThe scheme also focusses on quality R&D, capacity building through trainings, raising \nawareness through promotional activities like creation of Home/School Herbal Gardens. The \nscheme also seeks to support programs for quality assurance and standardization through \ndevelopment of Good Agriculture and Collection Practices (GACPs); development of monographs \nlaying down standards of quality, safety and efficacy; development of agro-techniques and a \ncredible institution a mechanism for certification of quality of raw drugs, seeds and planting \nmaterial. Apart from this, medicinal plants collection and trade accounts for as much as 40 to 50% \nof the household income in certain forest rich regions, hence, the scheme also aims at livelihood \nimprovement of local communities, especially in forest fringe areas. \n\nThe activities proposed to be undertaken in the scheme will also help the country to meet \nits international obligations in the field of medicinal plant's biodiversity and promoting bilateral / \ninternational cooperation which is not only critical for future growth of the sector but also for \nestablishing India as a global leader in the sector. \n\nObjectives of the Scheme: \n\nThe efforts of the National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) need to be considerably upscaled \nto tackle the whole range of issues impacting the sustained availability of quality herbs. The \nstrategy needs to focus on both cultivation and collection, together with R&D, promotion and \ninformation dissemination through IT dedicated mechanisms for procurement of Medicinal and \nAromatic Plants (MAPs), ensuring Minimum Support Price, setting up networked Agri-Mandis for \nMAPs, drawing up a database of cultivators and growers / cooperatives. Speciality warehousing & \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fstrengthening of the supply chain is another priority area. In order to cater to the domestic market \nneeds of Ayurveda, Siddha & Unani (ASU) industries, promotion of Primary Producer Companies \n(PPCs) should be taken-up in a focused manner. These organizations would then be brought into \nthe foreground for marketing of their produce (either cultivated or collected from wild). The most \nimportant aspect is of-course capacity building of all the stake-holders especially the collectors \nwho constitute the poorest of the poor of society \n\nThe main objectives of the scheme are as follows: \n\n Promote in-situ and / or ex-situ Conservation, Resource Augmentation of medicinal plants \n\n \n\nwhich are important to the AYUSH Industry and Folk Medicine. \nIn situ conservation measures would involve survey, inventorisation and documentation \nof important medicinal plants in their native/natural habitat coupled with resource \naugmentation in eco-systems where they form part of the naturally occurring biotic \ncommunity, preventing degradation of such eco-systems in a holistic manner and \nreversing the onslaught of invasive alien weeds; \n\n Promote ex-situ conservation by supporting such programs in rural / degraded forest / \n\npublic / non-public / institutional lands / urban & peri-urban lands and waste lands. \n\n Engage the Eco-Task Force mechanism for reversing habitat degradation of medicinal \nplants. Conservation & development of eco-systems with medicinal plants bio-diversity. \n\n Promote R&D in all aspects of medicinal plants, development of agro-techniques, post-\nharvest management, storage and processing, developing molecular characterization \ntools etc. \n\n Enhance livelihood systems based on medicinal plants for farmers, collectors and other \n\nstakeholders. \n\n Ensure Quality Assurance, Maintain Good Quality Gene Pool Sources of medicinal plants \nand aromatic plants having medicinal applications. Mapping, upgrading, modernizing of \nMedicinal Plants supply chain and creating/ optimizing market linkages and value addition. \n Quality standardization, Good Collection Practices and Good Agricultural Practices for \n\n \n\nMedicinal Plants. \nInformation, Education and Communication - through seminars, trainings and exposure \nvisits promote capacity building and human resource development through appropriate \ninter-state and international exposure. Promote publication of documents, monographs, \ntechnical bulletins, documentaries, brochures, posters, other publicity materials, etc. \n Take steps to meet India’s international obligations in the context of medicinal plant \n\nbiodiversity and promote bilateral / international cooperation. \n\n Strengthen NMPB so as to more efficiently co-ordinate all matters related to medicinal \nplants and function as a clearinghouse of information on medicinal plants including their \noccurrence, usage, ethno-botanical uses, cultivation practices, Post - harvest practices, \nmarkets etc. Institutional Strengthening of SMPBs and creating regional centres to \noptimize the strategic reach of the AYUSH systems. \n\n Promote mainstreaming of medicinal plants in climate change mitigation strategies & \npromote regeneration / afforestation of medicinal plant tree species towards carbon \nsequesterisation. \n\n Take steps to meet India's international obligations in the context of medicinal plant \n\nbiodiversity and promote bilateral/international cooperation. \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSTRATEGY \n\nThe scheme is proposed to be implemented during 2021-22 to 2025-26 to facilitate conservation \nand post-harvest management of Medicinal Plants for long term sustainability by adopting the \nfollowing strategy:- \n\na) Medicinal Plant Conservation Areas (MPCAs) by systematic survey, geo referencing of \nexisting natural population of medicinal and native aromatic species having medicinal use. \nb) Enhance conservation through in-situ and ex-situ resource augmentation and artificial re-\n\ngeneration of local populations of medicinal and aromatic plant species. \n\nc) Expand area under medicinal and aromatic plants species of medicinal values linked with \n\ncreation of nurseries to maintain good quality propagation material. \n\nd) Promote R & D to address the technology gaps particularly with respect to quality, \ndocumentation, identification of substitutes for important medicinal plants including Rare \nEndangered & Threatened (RET) listed plants and species with high demand in trade and \nbio-activity guided phyto-chemical studies, etc. \n\ne) Improve production, post-harvest technologies, and certification mechanisms for quality \nstandards, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Field Collection Practices (GFCP) and \nGood Storage Practices (GSP) value addition and marketing infrastructure. \n\nf) Stay abreast of International Developments impacting conservation, availability, trade, \n\nquality assurance of medicinal plants. \n\ng) Provide livelihoods and economic benefit to forest dwellers, cultivators, local healers and \n\nother stakeholders. \n\nNational Medicinal Plants Board \n\nThe Medicinal Plants Board was setup under a Government Resolution notified on 24th November \n2000. The objective of establishing a Board was to establish an agency which would be responsible \nfor coordination of all matters relating to medicinal plants. The Board has the function of coordinating \nwith Ministries / Department/Organizations /State/UT Governments for development of medicinal \nplants in general and specifically in the following fields: \n\n Assessment of demand / supply position relating to medicinal plants both within the country \n\n& abroad. \n\n Advise the concerned Ministries/ Department/ Organizations/ States/ UTs Governments \non policy matters relating to schemes and programs for development of medicinal plants. \n\n Provide guidance in the formulation of proposals, schemes and programs etc. to be taken \nby agencies having access to land for cultivation and infrastructure for collection, storage \ntransportation of medicinal plants. \n\n \n\nIdentification, inventorization and quantification of medicinal plants. \n\n Promotion of ex-situ and in-situ conservation and Resource Augmentation of medicinal \n\nplants. \n\n Promotion of co-operative effort among collectors and growers and assisting them to \n\nstore, transport and market their products respectively. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f Setting up of data base on medicinal plants, dissemination of information and facilitating \n\nprevention of patents on plants used in traditional systems. \n\n Matter relating to import/export of raw material, as well as value added products either as \nmedicine, food supplements or as herbal cosmetics including adoption of better techniques \nfor marketing of products to increase their reputation for quality and reliability in the country \nand abroad. \n\n Undertaking and awarding Scientific, Technological research and cost-effectiveness \n\nstudies. \n\n Development of protocols for cultivation and control. \n\n Encouraging the protection of Patent Rights and IPR. \n\nI.

The eligible organization can apply directly to \nNMPB online in the relevant proforma where the proposal will go through scrutiny by the Project \nScreening Committee (PSC) before being considered for approval by SFC. Prior to placing before \nthe PSC, wherever appropriate the research proposal can first be referred to subject expert by \nNMPB for taking expert's opinion on quality of the proposals. For such scrutiny a fee as approved \nby SFC will be paid to the domain expert by the NMPB for examination and comments. \n\nManagement Support \n\nOne project management Consultant along with Office Assistant / Data Entry Operator will be \n\n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fengaged for providing support at NMPB level for activities relating to scrutiny, implementation, \nmonitoring and technical support to the state. \n\n2.2 Quality Assurance \n\nObjectives \n\nToday globally companies are looking for traceability of raw materials to their source, as it is \nobvious that the quality of the end product can only be as good as the quality of the components \nthat go into that product. Hence the importance of maintaining good standards while collecting, \ncultivating and post-harvest handling of the raw material cannot be over emphasized. \n\n2.2.1 Promotion of Good Practices \n\n For India to become a global hub in medicinal plants processing, we need to list out the \nchallenges faced by the sector. One of the most important stakeholders is the group of \nintermediaries who are a very important part of the supply chain from collectors / cultivators \nto the end users of the raw material. These inter mediaries are largely in the private sector \nand deal with bulk handling of raw material from procurement to storage and sale in the \nmandies. This is the stage at which there are maximum chances of contamination of the raw \nmaterial, due to lack of general hygiene. Elimination of such sources of contamination is \nimperative for tackling the issues of microbial overload in herbal products. In order to do \nso, extensive capacity building of the intermediaries is required. There is a need to create \nawareness about maintenance of high standards of hygiene amongst collectors, \ncultivators, other raw material handlers and traders. This capacity building should be an \non-going process through a series of stakeholder meetings, workshops, seminars etc. A \nstrategy will be initiated for registration/devising regulation of important intermediaries in \nthe Market Supply Chain of medicinal plants. This will be done by providing support in a \nproject mode, to appropriate agencies. \nIn addition to this, we need to evolve norms for proper handling of raw material i.e. what \nconstitutes good practice as far as raw drug handling is concerned. Also there needs to \nbe in place a system of self-regulation through peer groups in mandies. Consultancies \nstudies will be commissioned for this purpose. This will also be addressed through \nfocussed projects through SFC approval. \n\n \n\n Presently testing is by and large limited to the finished products. Industry has always held \nthat in the absence of supply of contamination free raw material, it is not fair to expect the \nproducts to stand up to rigorous testing. Hence, maintaining a chain of practices to ensure \ngood quality of raw material will create a win-win situation for the producers / traders on \nthe one hand by ensuring better prices and the manufacturers on the other by ensuring \ngreater market access. This will also be supported in a consultancy / project mode. \n\nIn order, to more effectively address the above challenges the following measures will also be taken \nin project / consultancy mode: \n\na) Development of agro-techniques of selected medicinal plants. \n\nb) Protection of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Field Collection Practices \n(GFCP), Good Harvesting Practices (GHP) & Post Harvesting Practices, Good Storage \nPractices (GSP). The work done by Quality Council of India (QCI) for GAP &GFCP in the \n11thPlan will be taken forward towards actual field implementation in project mode. \n\n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fc) Support to testing laboratories, reimbursement of testing charges to stakeholders. \nd) Development of certification protocols for sustainable harvesting of seeds, planting \n\nmaterials and raw drugs from the wild in project mode. \n\ne) Other measures for Quality certification programmes as necessary. \n\n2.2.2 Raw Drug Repositories \n\nAnother important aspect of quality is the true botanical identity of the herb. To ensure proper \nidentity, there is a need to establish multiple Raw Drug Repositories (RDR), which can supply \ncertified samples of Indian medicinal plants on cost basis, to act as Reference Standards. \n\nPhytochemical Reference Standards (PRS) are required for assay purposes. There is a need to \ncreate a mechanism in India for consistent supply / sale of PRS required by various Pharmacopoeias \nfor quality assessment of Indian medicinal plants. \n\nFor this purpose, it is essential to establish multiple Raw Drug Repositories, in different areas of \nthe country. Each RDR could be encouraged to develop proficiency / core competence, in a few \nof the above listed scientific areas. \n\nThe RDR's should ideally work on development of \"Key Distinguishing Characters\" (KDC) for Indian \nmedicinal plants so that they can be distinguished from their look alike / adulterants. Some of the \ntechniques are: \n\n Pharmacognosy parameters like Macroscopy (organoleptic characters) \n Microscopy (Anatomy and powder microscopy), TLC, HPLC etc. \n DNA barcoding and fingerprinting \n Detection of characteristic / marker compounds \n Fingerprinting using new techniques like LC-MS-MS and NMR profile etc. \n\nNorms of Assistance \n\nFor national repository of raw drugs / BRS total assistance admissible is Rs.10.00 crores, while \nfor regional raw drug repositories it is Rs. 5.00 crores each to Govt. Organizations. \n\n3. \nStakeholders through Information Education and Communication (IEC) strategy: \n\nAwareness Building, Exposure Visits, Education and Capacity Building of \n\nMedicinal plant sector involves an array of stakeholders varying from resource managers, \ncultivators, gatherers, supply chain intermediaries, traders, local healers, researchers to \nmanufactures and exporters. It is necessary to disseminate information on different aspects of \nmedicinal plants like harvesting from wild, cultivation technologies, manufacturing, proper \nhandling of raw material, trade, etc. among various target groups about the importance of \ndevelopment and management through an appropriate outreach strategy, Capacity building, \nappropriate recognition, incentivisation etc. \n\nActivities \n\n Publicity through regular participation in Exhibitions/Fairs \n Aushadhi Vanaspati Mitra Program (AVMP) \n\n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f Organizing Workshops / Seminars / Conferences / Arogya Fair etc. \n Medicinal Plant Species specific/Campaigns \n Systematic use of Multimedia and other appropriate communication tools. \n Publication of Periodicals/Magazines and Newsletters \n Setting up and operation of Web Portal. \n Training and Capacity Building initiatives. \n\n3.1.

Reimbursable items of expenditure would include, hire charges, stall fabrication, \ndeveloping publicity material, travel and accommodation. Total financial implication for such \nparticipation per event will be Rs.1.00 Lakh for state level, Rs. 2.00 Lakhs for National level and \nRs.3.00 Lakhs for international level. For private organizations including Industry, the cost would \nbe limited to 50% of the above or the actual expenditure whichever is less (which includes Travel, \nAccommodation, hire charges, stall fabrication, publicity, etc.) will be reimbursed. The other \nactivities will be in project mode. \n\nSubmission of Proposals \n\nParticipation in fairs / exhibitions being time bound need to be examined as and when the \n\n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fproposals are received.

Defence establishments, Railways, Corporations and Municipalities, etc. \nin project mode. 2 - 4 such Herbal Gardens will be supported in each state at sites notified by the \nstate government specifically for this purpose in consultation with NMPB. \n\nActivities \n\nEstablishment and maintenance of herbal gardens, keeping in view all the required modalities like \nwalking trails, signages, landscaping, planting in beds and proper documentation, etc. Use of \nherbal gardens in supplying propagation / raw material will also be explored. \n\nNorms of Assistance \n\nThe proposal received in a project mode will be examined at PSC level and financial assistance \nwill be provided as per the actual requirement with the approval of SFC, NMPB. \n\nSubmission of Proposals \n\nEligible Organizations can apply to NMPB online where the proposal will go through scrutiny by \nthe Project Screening Committee (PSC) before approval by Standing Finance Committee (SFC). \n\nManagement Support \n\nOne project management Consultant along with Office Assistant / Data Entry Operator will be \nengaged for providing support at NMPB level for activities relating to scrutiny, implementation, \nmonitoring and technical support to the state. \n\n5. Other Promotional Activities \n\nSupport for establishing nursery and development of Quality Planting Material / Germ Plasm \nBanks \n\nActivities \n\nSupport for establishing small nursery as a part of project proposal other than cultivation will be \nprovided \n\nNorms of Assistance \n\nFor creation of nursery covering an area of 1 ha Rs.6.25 Lakhs per unit to be given in two \ninstallments. The assistance will be to the extent of 100% to public sector / SHGs and 50% of the \ncost subject to a ceiling of Rs.3.125 Lakhs in private sector. The nursery will have appropriate \ninfrastructure facility (net house, beds, vermi-compost, signage, irrigation system) to hold 50,000 \n\n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fto 70,000 plants. The organization must have a sustainability plan. \n\nMaintenance of existing medicinal plant nursery:- Existing medicinal plant nursery of \nMinimum five year old supported by NMPB, Ministry of Ayush may be provided financial \nassistance of upto Rs. 1.50 lakh/ha to raise 50,000-70,000 (approx.) sapling of medicinal plants \ndepending on reasonable justification. Further, if required the maintenance will be provided for \nmaximum twice after a span of five years. \n\nSubmission of Proposals \n\nEligible Organizations can apply to NMPB online where the proposal will go through scrutiny by \nthe Project Screening Committee (PSC) before approval by Standing Finance Committee (SFC). \n\n6. Other Interventions \n\n6.1 Bilateral / International cooperation and collaboration with International Agencies \n\nMinistry of AYUSH is exploring bilateral and international collaboration in the field of medicinal \nplants with other countries. MOUs for bilateral Collaboration in the field of medicinal plants has \nalready been developed for NMPB which could be appropriately fine-tuned for country specific \nneeds for collaboration requirements. In addition, Collaboration will be explored with international \nagencies like FAO, World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), UNDP, TRAFFIC, GEF, etc. \nfor mainstreaming of medicinal plant development strategies. \n\nThe traditional knowledge based on genetic resources needs to be brought under international \nbest practices on TK & GRs like Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS), Prior Informed Consent (PIC), \netc. There are international agreements and protocols to deal with all of these issues, which are \nconstantly evolving and we need to, not only keep abreast of all such developments but also get \nthem tailored to suit India's interest provided we are in a position to put forth our point of view at \nthe correct time. It is evident that the National Medicinal Plant Board (NMPB) should have a \ndedicated mechanism to carry out requisite spadework to enable it to forge linkages with likeminded \ncountries and render meaningful inputs to argue our case at the relevant international forums, like \nthe meetings of the Conference of Parties (CoPs) of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) \nespecially the current discussions on the ongoing program of work, access and benefit sharing \nissues under the Nagoya Protocol, trans-boundary issues under the Cartagena Protocol on \nbiosafety etc. \n\nActivities \n\n Participation in meetings of the relevant agencies at the international level. \n Exchange visits of experts with countries of interest especially those having similar \n\nbiogeography as India. \n\n Participation in reputed international seminars/exhibitions on botanicals such as Ingredients \nRussia, Food ingredient China, Vita Foods South America, Canadian Health Food \nAssociation, International Food Ingredients and Additives (IFIA), Japan, Supply Side West, \nCPHI, World Wide. A list of important events will be drawn up after the approval by the SFC. \nThis would also entail subsidizing industry desirous of such participation on reimbursement \nbasis. \n\n Setting up information centers on medicinal plants in Indian Missions abroad. \n Providing financial assistance for acquiring international certification. \n\n22 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f Subsidizing specific market promoting activities like product registrations, GRAS \n(Generally Recognized as Safe) affirmation, international certifications, positive listing of \nIndian botanicals in the importing countries (viz. ARTG of TGA) etc. \n\n Resolving issues of botanical ingredients which have been illogically banned by some \n\ninternational regulatory bodies. \n\n Commissioning studies on international regulations in the medicinal plants sector as \n\nknowledge about this is scarce at present. \n\nEligibility \n\nProposals from Industry and reputed agencies having experience in international regulation on \nmedicinal plants will be considered in project mode for commissioning studies. \n\nNorms of Assistance \n\nExpenditure incurred by the Industry organizations for participation in international exhibitions/ fairs \netc. would be reimbursed subject to prior permission being obtained from NMPB for participation \nby the concerned organization. Reimbursable items of expenditure would include, hire charges, \nstalls fabrication, developing publicity material, travel and accommodation. Reimbursement would \nbe limited to 50% of the expenditure of Rs.3.00 lakhs whichever is less. Other activities will be \nsupported in project mode with 100% assistance to Public Sector and 50% of the project cost to \nthe private sector. NMPB can also lead delegations / participate in these events. \n\n(a) Setting up of information centres in Indian Missions abroad \n\nInformation Centres for Medicinal Plants are a good way to create awareness of Indian \nmedicinal plants. The extent of financial support for this purpose will be determined on country-\nbasis on the recommendation of the concerned Indian Embassy, as per actual financial \nimplication. \n\nThe proposals in project mode formulated by NMPB will be examined and approved by SFC. \n\n(b) Commissioning studies on Specific aspects of medicinal plants \n\nObjectives \n\nTo keep pace with the increasing trend in demand for medicinal plants' raw materials, it is \nnecessary to 'periodically update the information on various aspects like production, collection, \nsupply & marketing. Such updating will be done by commissioning subject specific studies from \ntime to time Support for collection of statistical information related with various aspects of \nmedicinal plants may be provided to SMPB or other agencies identified having competence in this \narea by NMPB or the States. \n\nMajor areas of studies \n\nAn illustrative list of themes is as below:- \n\n Developing a data base of National and Regional Traders of medicinal plants and initiate \n\nwork towards their registrations. \n\n23 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f Developing a data base of Farmers / Cultivators. \n Demand and Supply of Medicinal Plants \n Livelihood / yield studies \n Supply Chain Mapping \n Rationalization of Transit Pass system \n Consolidation of Yield \n Whole sale Price Data \n Developing case studies and success stories \n\nSuch studies would be awarded as per GFR provisions. \n\nNorms for assistance \n\nProject based proposals will be considered by PSC/SFC. \n\n6.2. Marketing \n\nMarket Information Services are characterized by lack of domain information on techniques and \ncommercial opportunities, absence of Resource Centers with a regional MAP crop focus and little \nor no access to international markets. Currently marketing of MAPs happens through Mandis & \ncommodity boards, Agricultural produce marketing committees etc. There are numerous \nintermediaries. There are examples from states like Uttarakhand where the State Forest \nDevelopment Corporation have started both fixed and floating mandis which procure MAPs from \nthe doorstep of gatherers thus preventing exploitation and also ensuring remunerative prices. \n\nThe following steps will be taken up: \n\nIn order to cater to the domestic market needs of ASU industry, promotion of Primary Producer \nCompanies (PPCs) would be taken-up in a focused manner. These organizations would then be \nbrought into the foreground for marketing of their produce (either cultivated or collected from wild). \n\n Promotion and information dissemination through IT dedicated mechanisms for \n\nprocurement of MAPs. \n\n Networked Agri Mandis for MAPs \n\n Database of Cultivators \n\n Contract Extractions (PHM) \n\n Speciality Warehousing & Supply Chain development \n\n \n\nIntegration of all Portals with techno commercial information \n\n Creating an on line MAPs Trade Exchange \n\n \n\nIntegration with Krishak Call Centers, KVKs etc. \n\n24 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fa) Marketing Intervention \n\nCurrently marketing of Medicinal plant produce happens through Mandis and other whole sale \nmarkets. Trade is rather opaque and information on prices, arrivals and other trends are not easily \naccessible to farmers/growers. The following steps will be initiated in order to fill this gap. \n\nDocumenting trade practices. \n\n Generating information on wholesale prices, arrivals and trends in different markets to \n\nbenefit both growers and buyers. \n\n Establishing communication network for speedy collection and dissemination of market \n\ndata for its efficient and timely utilization. \n\n Preparing farmer's advisories and issuing the same for the Benefit of farmers towards \n\noptimizing returns. \n\n Developing Databases of Cultivators and Cultivars. \n \n\nIntegrating and mainstreaming of Medicinal Plants through call centres including Kisan \ncall centres initiatives of Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer’s Welfare. \n\n Putting in place an appropriate pricing regime in respect of produce sourced from wild v/s \ncultivation in favour of cultivated material so as to encourage cultivation and reduce \npressure on the natural resources. \n\n Streamlining of HS Codes. \n\nEligibility \n\nProposals from reputed agencies having experience in in the field on medicinal plants will be \nconsidered in project mode for commissioning studies. \n\nSubmission of proposals \n\nEligible Organizations can apply to NMPB where the proposal will go through scrutiny by the \nProject Screening Committee (PSC) before approval by Standing Finance Committee (SFC). \n\nb) Minimum Support Price (MSP) \n\nIn order to supplement the efforts of state governments to encourage sustainable collection of \nmedicinal plants, NMPB would support State agencies engaged in procurement of medicinal plants \nto the extent of 25% of the amount paid by the agency to the collectors. \n\n Such support from NMPB will be provided to State Governments which have a definite \n\nmechanism for providing MSP support for medicinal plants. \n\n The support of MSP for medicinal plants however will not be automatic but would be \nconsidered on a case to case basis in project mode based on the steps taken by State \ngovt. and which are likely to support or result in aiding to help conservation & sustainable \nlivelihoods. \n\n The mount of MSP support would be released in two instalments subject to the states \ndemonstrating that this measure has a positive impact on conservation & livelihood \ngeneration and the material thus produced is used by industry. \n\n25 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fManagement Support \n\nOne Project Management Consultant along with one Office Assistant / Data Entry Operator will \nbe engaged for providing support at NMPB level for activities relating to scrutiny, implementation, \nmonitoring and technical support to the state. \n\n7. \n\nMedicinal Plant Species Specific Campaign including use of Multimedia \n\nSpecies Specific Campaigns will be launched Nationally or at State level for valuable medicinal \nplants like, Pipli, Chirata, RET species, Amla, Moringa etc. to promote usage and planting \nincluding in institutions, schools, homes, etc.. The campaigns will also identify barriers to wide \navailability and use of such species and seek to address the same. The media publicity both print \nand electronic would also be a part of the campaign and would be organized by both SMPB and \nNMPB. Multimedia campaigns for important medicinal plants and its products through radio, TV \nand print would be taken up to provide information on the importance of medical plants in daily \nlife. For this purpose TV spots would be developed through selected agencies and be telecast \non TV, radio and outdoor hoardings, etc. Besides, talk shows and other programs on radio & TV \nand preparation of documentaries/case studies etc. would be promoted. \n\nEligibility \n\n SMPBs and other State Government organizations. \n Recognized academic / Research / Educational institutions \n Registered professional, NGOs and other philanthropic Organizations working on non- profit \n\nbasis with activities / experience in the field of medicinal plants. \n\nNorms of Assistance \n\nFor Medicinal Plant Species specific campaign, financial assistance will be provided to the eligible \norganisations in project mode. \n\nSubmission of Proposals \n\nEligible Organizations can apply to NMPB online where the proposal will go through scrutiny by \nthe Project Screening Committee (PSC) before approval by Standing Finance Committee (SFC). \n\n8 \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n8.1. Strengthening of State Medicinal Plant Boards (SMPBs) \n\n The SMPBs in addition to act coordinating as well as Implementing Agency for various \nactivities supported under NMPB, Ministry of AYUSH’s scheme, are expected to synergise \nvarious interventions by other State agencies related to Medicinal Plants. In order to \nencourage the states to have an independent office of the SMPB it is proposed that an annual \ngrant-in-aid upto Rs.35.00 lakhs per annum can be provided to SMPBs other than SMPBs \nof Union Territories (UTs) and North Eastern States and for SMPBs which are under Union \nTerritories (UTs) and North Eastern States grant-in- aid upto Rs.27.00 lakhs per annum can \nbe provided on annual basis. The assistance/budget will be provided towards remuneration \n\n26 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fof staff (on contractual basis), to meet the expenditure on recurring and non-recurring office \nexpenses, purchase of equipment, office maintenance, mobility support and miscellaneous \nexpenditure including TA/DA/POL, printing/publicity, meeting/conferences, engaging subject \nmatter specialist/ statistical unit etc. In the interest of co-ordination and synergy, NMPB will \nalso direct the States to employ suitable resources/consultants for specific purposes like \npreparing database of traders, cultivators, compilation of yield data, demand and supply of \nmedicinal plants from different sources like Forest Department & cultivators, case studies, \npublication, participation in events related to medicinal plants, exposure visits for stake \nholders etc. NMPB may also promote special studies to evaluate functioning of SMPBs from \ntime to time. An indicative structure and break-up of head-wise staff support to SMPB is \ngiven in Annexure-II. Full time CEO / Member Secretary and separate Budget Head for SMPB \nin the state budget shall be preferred for the Nucleus Centre Grant or else it can be modified by \nNMPB. \n\n SMPBs are required to submit annual action plans in advance indicating the various activities \n\nand programmes they intend to carry out in the State on year-to-year basis. \n\n \n\nIn addition to Nucleus Centre grant, the grant-in-aid can be considered for SMPBs to meet \nthe obligations of Contractual Farming activities / projects of previous plan period, if any. \n\n SMPBs are required to work in close coordination with Regional-cum-Facilitation Centres \n\n(RCFCs) of NMPB and with other State agencies related to Medicinal Plants. \n\n8.2. Establishing Regional-cum-Facilitation Centres (RCFCs) of NMPB (within existing \nGovernment Institutions, Corporations, Centres of Excellence etc.) in different Geographic \nZones. \n\nConsidering the topographical spread and valuable traditional knowledge on medicinal plants in \nvarious parts of the country, the success of AYUSH system in the national context actually depends \non region and area specific inputs and active participation of regional units in the implementation \nof the scheme and facilitation thereof. Coordination with states in respect of NMPB schemes for \neach region is currently constrained and harm-strung by the absence of adequate outreach in \nvarious regions of the country. Hence, there is a need to set up the Regional-cum-Facilitation \nCentres (RCFCs). However, no significant infrastructure needs to be created, instead such \nRCFCs will be set up within the existing Government Departments / Institutions (like Institution of \nICAR, CSIR, ICFRE, Universities, AYUSH Institutions etc.) in various eco- regions of the country \nthrough signing of MOUs by NMPB with the approval of the SFC. The State Medicinal Plants \nBoards (SMPBs) in a geographic region of the country will also be mentored by these RCFCs. The \nRegional-cum-Facilitation Centres will be actively engaged in the meetings on technical matters of \nthe SMPBs and also assist in the monitoring of projects sanctioned and other assigned work by \nNMPB. \n\nIt is proposed to set up Seven such RCFCs in existing regional institutions and will have the \nfollowing coverage: \n\nS.No. \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nName of Regional-cum-\nFacilitation Centre \nNorthern Region – I \n\nNorthern Region – II \n\nStates / UTs \n\nChandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, \nPunjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh \nJammu & Kashmir, Ladakh \n\n27 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3. \n4. \n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nCentral Region \nEastern Region \nSouthern Region \n\nNorth Eastern Region \n\nWestern Region \n\nChhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh \nBihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, West Bengal \nAndaman & Nicobar, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, \nKerala, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, \nTelangana \nArunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, \nMizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura \nDadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Goa, Gujarat, \nMaharashtra, Rajasthan \n\nSelection of institutions as Regional Cum Facilitation Centre Facilitation Centres (RCFCs) \n\nResearch and extension organisations or universities in the above mentioned regions will be \nidentified by open advertisement in Newspapers. The selection of Regional-cum-Facilitation \nCentres in different institutions shall be undertaken through a committee of 4 or 5 experts which \nwill be constituted as and when required. The same committee shall also periodically review the \nprogress in implementation of the activities of RCFCs and guide NMPB. The support to these \nregional centres shall be in project mode and shall be decided with the approval of the Secretary, \nMinistry of AYUSH / Standing Finance Committee. The Budget and activities can be decided with \nthe approval of SFC as and when required. \n\nPattern of Financial Assistance: \n\n 100% financial assistance (in project mode) shall be provided for Government Departments and \nOrganizations including Govt. aided institutions (Institutes getting substantial aid), Universities, \nResearch Institutes etc. as decided with the approval of the Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH / \nStanding Finance Committee . \n\n Some of the Regional Centres actively engaged in medicinal plants related activities and having \n\nadequate expertise & infrastructure can be considered as Centre of Excellence. \n\nManagement Support: \n\nProgramme Manager, Domain Expert, Consultant, Jr. Consultant along with Office Assistant / Data \nEntry Operator etc. will be engaged for providing support at NMPB level to co-ordinate the programme \n/ activities. \n\n9.

Such decisions will be taken by CEO, \nNMPB on case to case basis and brought to notice of PSC for information. \nFor important projects under implementation which may require technical input from the PSC \nthe PI may be called for presentation from time to time by PSC so that best value could be \nobtained from such ongoing works. \n\nxii) Under non-recurring head, financial assistance could be provided for only selected, essential \nand specialized items of equipments required for project works, for modification of existing \nstructure so for undertaking petty works. \n\nxiii) The implementing institution, without approval of the CEO, NMPB, shall not re-appropriate \nfunds among different heads of expenditures of a scheme, except in case of recurring \ncontingencies. \n\nxiv) Component towards rental value of land/lease rent shall not exceed 10% of project cost. \nxv) Expenses towards manpower for supervision, and other technical input shall be as per \n\nrequirement. \n\nxvi) Grant-in-aid will be further subjected to the Terms and Conditions as indicated elsewhere in \n\n32 \n\n \n \n\fxvii) \n\nthe guidelines or in the letter of sanction. \nIt will invariably be the sole duty of the PI and his organization to abide by all laws while \nimplementing the project. \n\nxviii) Cost norms for activities in high alpine regions and trans Himalayan regions could be upto 1 \n½ times of otherwise prescribed norms. This could be decided by the SFC on a case to case \nbasis. \n\nxix) For any other components in the Scheme for which specific costs, norms have not been given, \n\nthese will be considered by SFC in project mode. \n\nxx) Within approved project period, grants, released in a year will be deemed to be carried forward \n\nxxi) \n\nto the next year if not fully utilized in the initial year. \nIn a need based approach to enable response to changing situations SFC may decide to \nincorporate additional activities within the overall outlay of the Scheme. \n\nxxii) Proformas and terms and conditions shall be uploaded on the NMPB website. The same will \nalso be reviewed / fine-tuned from time to time by the PSC and shall be dully intimated to the \nSFC. \n\nxxiii) Periodic progress reports received from the PI will be reviewed by the concerned \nprogramme officer in the NMPB so as to decide the progress is satisfactory or \nthere are any shortfall or any course correction is needed for which feedback has \nto be given to the implementing organization. \n\nxxiv) An annual increase of 10% of the outlay of the sanctioned amount will be provided \n\nfor conservation & Resource augmentation projects. \n\n12. Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nI. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation by the State Medicinal Plants Boards. \n\nThe State Medicinal Plant Boards (where they are themselves not the implementing agency) can be \ninvolved in monitoring the projects at the field level through their own set of experts for mentoring \nand suggesting corrective measures. The SMPBs can approach NMPB for offering their \nwillingness for undertaking this assignment. Therefore, field mentoring and monitoring of all \nprojects can be undertaken by SMPB's / other organizations and for this purpose, the services of \nretired officers of Forests / Horticulture / Agriculture departments, scientists etc. may be hired within \nthis grant approved for SMPB / other organizations. \n\nII. \n\nThird Party Monitoring \n\nThird party monitoring is important for the success of any scheme being implemented at the national \nlevel. There could be two types of arrangements - either through the system of experts or hiring \nan agency. One or more National Level Agencies with adequate manpower and infrastructure will \nbe engaged by NMPB to monitor the projects as per requirement. In addition, NMPB may also \nconstitute short term mentoring-cum-monitoring teams from time to time for specific projects, as \nfelt necessary. \n\nIII. Chief Technical Advisers / Domain Expert for Mentoring \n\nNMPB will draw up a list of experts and nominate theme wise / species wise experts as Chief Technical \nAdvisers (CTAs) on important themes related to medicinal plants. The CTAs will be asked from time \nto time to visit States / Project implementation locations to provide hand-holding support on their \narea of expertise to the states / implementing agencies and for providing such services, CTAs will \nbe reimbursed AC II tier / Economy Class Air fare and local travelling expenses, Boarding / lodging \n\n33 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fcharges etc. and will also be eligible for sitting fee as per rule. However, such hand holding \nassignments (excluding travel time from their HQ) will be of short duration (3 days or less) after which \nCTAs will submit the reports to NMPB, for each such assignment. \n\nNMPB can also engage Domain Expert as per requirement for implementation and monitoring of \nthe projects / activities. \n\nNote: The proforma for submission of the proposals and utilization certificates, progress \nreport etc. are available on NMPB’s website. \n\n34 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fS.

The Ayurveda has its\norigins from the India and extended its wings in various parts of\nthe world. Ayurveda was taught in Gurukula system in ancient\ndays, which is now been evolved in to under graduate & post\ngraduate courses from Institutions.\nAbout Section end\nlayout section end\nfooter section start\nSignup (Student & institute) start\nSignup (Student & institute) end\n<footer class=\"section-footer\">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-lg-5 col-md-6 col-sm-12\">\n<div class=\"widget-a\">\n<div class=\"w-header-a mb-2\">\n<a href=\"https://main.ayush.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\"><img\nalt=\"moa-logo\" data-src=\"admin/assets/img/ayushlogo-w.png\"\nclass=\"lazy\"></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"w-body-a\">\n<p class=\"w-text-a\">?????

    "content": "Traditional herbal medicine legislative and regulatory framework: a cross-sectional quantitative study and archival review perspectives\nSileshi Dubale\nRashed Edris Usure\nYesuneh Tefera Mekasha\nGemmechu Hasen\nFirdos Hafiz\nDereje Kebebe\nSultan Suleman\nSchool of Pharmacy, Mattu University, Mattu, Ethiopia\nSchool of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Hawassa University, Hawassa, Ethiopia\nPharmaceutical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia\nJimma University Laboratory of Drug Quality (JuLaDQ), School of Pharmacy, Institute of Health, Jimma University, Jimma, Ethiopia\nMedicine Registration and Licensing, Ethiopian Food and Drug Administration, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\nSchool of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutics, Jimma University, Jimma, Ethiopia\nBackground:\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reports that a significant portion of the global population relies on traditional herbal medicine (THM) due to limited access to safe and high-quality modern medical care. In developing countries, it is difficult to guarantee the safety and quality of THM due to weak enforcement of the legal and regulatory framework. Hence, the study attempted to evaluate the country’s legislative and regulatory framework by comparing it with developed and developing countries that have well-established systems and identify gaps for future roadmaps in the THM landscape.\nMethods:\nA cross-sectional study and archival review were performed from November 2021 to March 2022 G.C. to contrast the legislative and regulatory framework for THM regulation with other selected countries like Africa, India, and China. A total of 237 regulatory personnel participated in the study. Data were collected through an archive assessment, self-administrative questionnaires, and literature searches. Secondary data were extracted from the archival review, and the findings were summarized and presented in tabular and text formats. The quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 26, with outputs presented in text, table, and figure form.\nResults:\nThe archival review of the study found that Ethiopia’s THM legislative and regulatory framework is still in a developmental phase, particularly when compared with countries that have more established systems. A cross-sectional study indicated that approximately 79.7% of participants were aware of THM-related content in the current legislation. However, 82.3% reported they had not received any formal training on THM regulations. For future roadmaps, 73.8% of respondents believed the government showed a commitment to supporting THM regulation, though 51.9% of participants noted limited knowledge and awareness of THM practices and product regulations. In terms of quality, safety, efficacy, rational use, and storage conditions, 49.8% of respondents rated regulatory implementation practice as not satisfactory. In this study, most study participants raised concerns about the performance of quality control parameters. Among regulatory experts, weak performance was identified in the practical implementation of THM regulatory activities, with 70.2% of weak performance observed at the federal level and 41.7% at the regional level. Key barriers to effective regulation included a lack of research on herbal medicines (90.3%) and insufficient regulatory mechanisms (87.8%). Additional challenges for regulatory offices included traditional healers’ reluctance to engage with scientific communities (56.5%), inadequate inspections (55.3%), and limited data on the safety, quality, and efficacy of certain medicinal plants (54.4%).\nConclusion:\nOverall, the Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority (EFDA) is significantly strengthening the legislative and regulatory framework for traditional herbal medicines (THM), although full implementation is still forthcoming. This study highlights the need for comprehensive policy development, improved training initiatives, and reinforced regulatory systems to effectively monitor and regulate THM practices. For future roadmaps, collaboration among traditional healers, regulatory bodies, and scientific communities, along with supporting evidence-based research, could further enhance THM regulation in Ethiopia. These collaborative endeavors are critical for promoting the safety and quality of products derived from herbal medicines.\n1 Introduction\nOyebode et al., 2016\n). Hence, much of the world population uses traditional medicines (TMs) to fulfill their healthcare needs (\nWHO, 2019\nWHO, 2013\n). A report from the World Health Organization revealed that around 80% of individuals in developing nations rely on herbal medicine for their primary healthcare needs (\nWHO, 2013\n). However, the presence of inadequate legal herbal frameworks (\nUsure et al., 2024\n) has hindered the herbal medicine sectors. The existing body of literature indicates that modern drug regulation systems receive significant attention, while traditional governance practices, which are largely unrecorded, are often disregarded (\nChebii et al., 2020\nThe high occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in sub-Saharan African nations (\nMekasha and Godena, 2021\n) necessitates a shift away from modern medications toward utilizing locally sourced herbal remedies. Herbal remedies are cost-effective, readily accessible, less prone to resistance, and affordable (\nMahomoodally, 2013\nThakur et al., 2011\n). The rise in the usage of herbal-based products throughout the region has led to growing concerns regarding the quality and safety of these products, which in turn may have implications for public health (\nAra et al., 2020\nBarkat et al., 2021\n). A well-organized, sustainable governance system is essential for ensuring a consistent supply of traditional medicine. This can be achieved by implementing sustainable practices such as conservation, cultivation, proper harvesting, regulated trade, and controlled use (\nBussmann et al., 2016\n). The regulatory frameworks for herbal medicine in many African nations are currently inadequate and underdeveloped (\nChebii et al., 2020\nUsure et al., 2024\nAs the demand for herbal medicinal products increases worldwide and numerous new products are introduced to the market, the importance of strong regulatory activity becomes evident. This is crucial in addressing public health concerns and ensuring the safety of these products. Although certain herbal medicines show promising potential and enjoy widespread usage, a significant number of them remain untested, and their usage is not adequately monitored (\nMoreira et al., 2014\n). This limits knowledge of their potential adverse effects and makes the identification of the safest and most effective therapies, as well as the promotion of their rational use, more difficult (\nWHO, 2002\n). It is also common knowledge that the safety of most herbal products is further compromised by a lack of suitable quality controls, inadequate labeling, and the absence of appropriate patient information (\nRaynor et al., 2011\n). In many regions of Africa, herbal remedies are commonly available for purchase in open markets, stores, and through traditional healers, as there is often a weak legal framework in place that does not require scientific evidence of their safety, effectiveness, or quality (\nSharad et al., 2011\nStudies in sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, and Uganda reveal significant gaps in policy implementation and design (\nJames et al., 2018\n). Notably, Kenya lacks a registration system for herbal medicines, leading to unrestricted sales (\nOnyambu et al., 2019\n). In contrast to developing countries, thorough literature reviews conducted by regulatory bodies in various developed countries have played a significant role in formulating guiding principles to tackle issues concerning herbal medicines (\nRamakrishna and Reddy, 2017\n). The legal status and utilization of herbal drug products differ greatly from country to country. Regulations in developed nations are considered to be the most thorough compared to other global regulations for herbal medicinal products (\nLee et al., 2021\n). For instance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has acknowledged the importance of herbal medicines through federal law No. 20 of 1995. This legislation, titled “Medicines and products derived from natural sources,” specifically addresses the regulation of herbal medicines at a national level (\nMirzaeian et al., 2019\nWHO, 2019\n1.1 Archival review of legislative and regulatory framework of herbal medicine in selected developed and developing countries\nThe regulatory framework for herbal medicine is robust in economically advanced nations like the United States of America (United States), Germany, Japan, and the European Union (EU). For instance, the authorities that regulate HM in Germany, the United States, and Japan also regulate conventional medicines (\nWHO, 2019\n). In Germany, herbal medicines (HMs) are also regulated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) due to Germany’s membership in the European Union (\nPeschel, 2007\n). The Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive (THMPD), also known as Directive 2004/24/EC, amends Directive 2001/83/EC specifically for traditional herbal medicinal products. This directive allows herbal medicinal products to be sold with combinations of certain specified minerals and vitamins. These herbal products are readily available over-the-counter (OTC) to the general public in standard formulations, either as single herbs (simples) or in mixtures (\nPeschel, 2007\nThe pharmaceutical medicine regulatory system in the United States is widely recognized as the global benchmark for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs. Nevertheless, significant concerns have been raised regarding the adequacy of the regulation of herbal medicines (HMs) as dietary supplements in the country. The United States is the primary market for the pharmaceutical industry and currently offers around 20,000 HMs, valued at approximately US$ 62 billion. The World Health Organization predicts that this figure will soar to an astounding US$ 5 trillion by 2050 (\nAlostad et al., 2018\n). Hence, developed countries prioritize herbal medicines as equivalent to modern pharmaceuticals.\nChina, India, Pakistan, Brazil, and Bahrain are nations with extensive historical backgrounds and established practices of traditional medicine. These countries have taken significant strides in incorporating various herbal medicine products into their healthcare systems. This fact is supported by the substantial presence of HM products in both national pharmacopeias and national essential drug lists (NEDL) (\nPicking, 2024\n). Notably, China and India, as the leading producers and exporters of medicinal plant (MP) products, demonstrate commendable HM regulation among developing nations (\nHe et al., 2015\nAccording to WHO reports, herbal medicines in India are regulated under the Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani drugs provision in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act (\nWHO, 2019\n). Furthermore, herbal medicines (HM) are marketed in India with medical claims, health claims, and nutrient content claims, falling under the categories of prescription and nonprescription medicines. The Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha pharmacopeias are recognized and enforced by law in India. Additionally, the Indian herbal pharmacopeia is utilized, although it is not held as legally binding. In the Indian market, prescription HMs are distributed in pharmacies, while nonprescription HMs, for self-medication or over-the-counter use, are available in pharmacies, other retail outlets, and through licensed practitioners (\nWHO, 2019\nIn Bahrain, herbal medicines are sold as prescription medicines, nonprescription medicines, or OTC medicines in pharmacies and other outlets, in special outlets such as in HM stores, and by licensed practitioners (\nWHO, 2019\nAlostad et al., 2019\n). The nation implemented regulations for herbal medicines that mirror those of traditional pharmaceuticals. In Bahrain, herbal medicines are categorized as prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and health products. Manufacturers of herbal medicines must adhere to the same manufacturing standards as those for traditional pharmaceuticals. To ensure compliance, manufacturers are obligated to provide samples of their products to a government-approved laboratory for testing and submit the latest good manufacturing practices (GMP) certification from their local authority. Safety requirements for herbal medicines in Bahrain are akin to those for traditional pharmaceuticals. All complementary and alternative medicine products (excluding herbal medicines specifically) must be registered in Bahrain (\nAlostad et al., 2019\nThe WHO reported that Pakistan introduced the “Alternate Medicine Health Products Enlistment Rules” in 2014 to regulate HM (\nWHO, 2019\n). Herbal medicines are sold with claims about medical, health, and nutrient content, but these are unregulated in Pakistan. The American herbal pharmacopeia, WHO monographs, and EU monographs are used, but the information in the pharmacopeias is not legally binding. There are exclusive regulations for GMP, separate from those for conventional pharmaceuticals. The mechanisms that ensure compliance and t regulatory acts to control manufacturing have yet to be enacted in Pakistan (\nWHO, 2019\n). Traditional use without demonstrated harmful effects is considered sufficient for the safety assessment of HMs. There are no restrictions on selling herbal products. The annual market sales for HM in Pakistan in the years 2007, 2008, and 2009 were estimated by the Pakistan Tibbi and Homeopathic Manufacturers Association data to be US$ 5.5 million, US$ 6.5 million, and US$ 7 million, respectively (\nWHO, 2019\nRasheed et al., 2019\nThe 2019 WHO survey report indicates that only 23 countries out of 54 African countries sales herbal medicine as per claims as per regulatory guidelines, while countries such as Eretria and Tunisia have no reported claims related to herbal medicine sales. Information regarding this matter is not clearly available for other countries. Sao Tome, Principe, and Burundi are among the countries that sell herbal medicine with claims yet lack legal regulations for those sales (\nWHO, 2019\n). Research carried out in Nigeria revealed that among 16 key informants, 68.8% acknowledged the existence of a national policy on traditional medicine (TM), while 31.2% expressed disagreement on this matter. Additionally, 75% of the respondents confirmed that the enforcement of manufacturing standards for herbal medicines is guaranteed through regulatory measures, whereas 25% held a contrary opinion (\nAwodele et al., 2014\n). Only 25% indicated that licensed practitioners are involved in the sale of herbal medicines, while 75% believed that non-licensed practitioners are responsible for this (\nAwodele et al., 2014\n). In addition, 87.5% emphasized the necessity of support from the WHO in the form of workshops aimed at enhancing national capacity for monitoring the safety of herbal medicines.\nA study conducted in Kenya (64) revealed that many unregulated herbal medicinal products had high levels of microbial contamination. The microbial loads in these unregistered samples ranged from 3.00 × 10\ncfu/mL to 1.56 × 10\ncfu/mL, which far exceeded the standards set by BP or USP, requiring levels below 100 cfu/mL. Among the microbial isolates,\nE. coli\nwas found in approximately 75% of the unregistered product samples, followed by\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nEnterobacter aerogenes\n, and\nS. aureus\nin 70%, 60%, and 45% of the samples, respectively.\nSalmonella\nspp. was isolated in 40% of the samples, while\nShigella\nspp. was found in 20% of the samples (\nOnyambu et al., 2013\n). These findings indicate that none of the unregistered samples met the microbial load limits set by pharmacopeias for both bacterial and fungal contamination. Therefore, it is vital to extend regulatory activities currently implemented for pharmaceutical medicines to herbal medicinal products in order to improve their microbial quality and safety.\nAfrican countries regulate HMs as herbal medicines, nonprescription medicines, prescription medicines, dietary supplements, health food, and functional food. In Africa, HMs are most often regulated in the herbal medicines category, followed by the nonprescription medicine, prescription medicine, and dietary supplement categories. However, some countries have multiple regulatory categories. Countries like Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, and Tanzania regulate them as herbal medicines, nonprescription medicines, and prescription medicines. In Mauritania, HM regulation has five different regulatory categories, whereas Nigeria regulates them as herbal medicines and different types of food (\nWHO, 2019\nKasilo et al., 2019\nThe literature showed that the herbal medicine regulation systems in Kenya (\nChebii et al., 2020\n), Ghana (\nThakkar et al., 2020\n), and Uganda (\nUganda NDA, 2020\n) provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these countries’ approaches compared to Ethiopia. These countries have made significant strides in establishing regulatory frameworks that ensure the safety, quality, and efficacy of herbal medicines. They have implemented comprehensive legislation, established regulatory bodies, and developed guidelines for the registration and licensing of herbal products. In contrast, Ethiopia’s herbal medicine regulation system lacks such robust measures, leading to a lack of control over the quality and safety of herbal medicines in the country (\nUsure et al., 2024\n). This was why the authors became interested in the current context of comparing the legal framework of Ethiopian herbal medicine with that of a robust regulatory system for herbal medicine. Particularly in Ethiopia, there is no post-market surveillance system, restriction on the sale of herbal medicines, or guidelines for clinical trials using traditional medicines. An initiative has been made to establish guidelines for licensing and minimum standards for traditional practice and practitioners. A committee from the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Veterinary Drug and Animals Food Administration and Control Authority (VDFACA), and the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI) is preparing standards for the safety, efficacy, and quality of traditional medicine. Different studies were conducted on the toxicology and efficacy of drugs in the Drug Research Department of the EHNRI (\nTeshome, 2017\nAmare, 2010\nIn Ethiopia, TM practiced by traditional healers constitutes the use of natural substances composed of plants, animals, and minerals as remedies, in addition to spiritual healing and some practices like bone setting. The Ethiopian flora is estimated to contain between 6,500 and 7,000 species of higher plants, of which about 12% are endemic, and more than 90% of TM preparations are of medicinal plant origin (\nJames et al., 2018\nTesfahuneygn and Gebreegziabher, 2019\n). Despite the significance of HM uses, the safety and therapeutic value of HM products and practices cannot always be guaranteed and remains largely unregulated (\nTeshome, 2017\nAbdisa, 2017\nAbay, 2009\n). This study offers a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory framework for traditional herbal medicines (THM) in Ethiopia, comparing it to global standards. It highlights the risks associated with inadequate regulation, particularly the public health dangers posed by substandard or poor-quality herbal products. The finding underlines the critical need to strengthen regulatory enforcement to protect public safety and ensure the quality of THM. Specifically, the study evaluates the existing legislative and regulatory structures governing THM in Ethiopia, identifying areas for improvement that could align the country’s practices with internationally accepted standards.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Study setting and period\nThe study was conducted from November 2021 to March 2022 in the selected region, namely Oromia and the Southern Nationalities, Nations, and Peoples (SNNPR) regions, and one administrative city of Ethiopia. Ethiopia, located at the horn of Africa, is one of the oldest civilizations and the second most populous country in Africa, with a diversity of cultures and languages (\nCrummey et al., 2024\n). Approximately 80% of the Ethiopian cultures support TM, of which 95% are sourced from plants (\nAbebe, 1986\n). Ethiopia operates under a federal government administration system, which is divided into 11 regional states and two city administrations. These divisions encompass diverse agro-ecological zones. Additionally, the country has a unified regulatory authority responsible for overseeing both food and drug regulations, as well as herbal medicine.\n2.2 Study design\nAn institutional-based descriptive quantitative study and an archival review were conducted from November 2021 to March 2022 G.C. The archival review was employed to compare the legal framework for THM regulation in Ethiopia with that of various African countries, India, and China. The aim was to evaluate the comprehensiveness and adequacy of Ethiopia’s medical-legal basis. The selection of African countries was based on a thorough review that identified the regulatory status of THM in most African countries using a checklist (\nSupplementary File 1\n) that was developed based on WHO Conventional Medicine regulation data-gathering tools used in the second and third global surveys (\nWHO, 2019\n2.3 Source and study population\nThe source population for quantitative data was all federal and regional-level authorities, directorates, offices, and case teams that were directly involved in medicine and health regulation. For qualitative data, the source population was all federal and regional-level authorities, directorates, offices, and case teams that were selected for quantitative data, and other institutions and associations that work with health and medicine regulatory offices on THM regulation. The study population contained all selected federal and regional-level authorities, directorates, offices, and case teams that were directly involved in medicine and health regulation and executed THM. The randomly selected sample frames for the present study lists were found in\nSupplementary File 2\n2.4 Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nThe study included federal and regional-level authorities, directorates, offices, and case teams directly involved in medicine and health regulation, specifically those with regulatory experience and information on THM. Additionally, participants from selected offices, case teams, and associations were included, as well as traditional herbalists who had been registered and actively practicing for 2 years or more. Regulatory officials who were not engaged in THM regulation-related activities were excluded from the study. Furthermore, consumers of THM and members of patient advocacy organizations were also excluded.\n2.5 Sample size determination\nFor the quantitative data, because the source population of this study was medicine and health regulatory offices (MHROs), the sample size of the study was determined by the total number of study units that existed in the selected MHROs. In view of that, EFDA has 113 regulatory personnel in its four selected directorates. The regional medicine and health regulatory offices regulated TM by two case teams (health facility control (THM facility) and product quality control). Accordingly, based on the standard human resource allocation of Oromia and SNNPR regions, health bureaus, the regional-level MHROs should contain 20 regulatory personnel, and each zonal- and town-level MHRO should contain four regulatory personnel. As a result, the total regulatory personnel working in selected MHROs of the Oromia region for quantitative data was estimated to be 84 (20 at regional offices + (4 × 7 at zones) + (4 × 9 at towns) = 84, while 60 regulatory personnel were estimated to work in selected MHROs of the SNNPR region [20 at regional offices + (4 × 5 at zones) + (4 × 5 at towns) = 60].\nIn addition, 128 regulatory personnel were estimated to work in selected MHROs of Addis Ababa city for quantitative data [20 at city-level Food, Medicine, and Healthcare Administration and Control Authority (FMHACA) + (4 × 6 at sub-cities) + (14 × 6 at woredas)]. Therefore, the total expected number of regulatory personnel working in MHROs selected from the federal and regional levels for quantitative data was 385 (113 in EFDA, 84 in Oromia, 60 in SNNPR, and 128 in Addis Ababa). As a result, because the study units were small in number, the sample size calculation was not conducted. However, for various reasons, all study units that were estimated based on the standard did not participate in the study. The first reason is that some selected regional medicine and health regulatory offices contain fewer than estimated regulatory professionals. As a result, the total study units that were actually working in selected regional MHROs during data collection were 333 (67 in Oromia, 46 in SNNPR, 107 in Addis Ababa, and 113 in EFDA). In addition, of 333 regulatory personnel, some (24 employees) only worked for a month in selected regulatory offices. In addition, some regulatory personnel were not present in their offices during data collection times for different reasons. Thus, 237 of 309 regulatory personnel who met the inclusion criteria actually participated in the quantitative data collection, with a respondent rate of 76.7%.\n2.6 Data collection method and sampling procedure\nThe sample was collected using a combination of an archive assessment of Ethiopia’s legislative and regulatory framework, self-administered questionnaires, and literature searches. Each data collection technique was primarily based on the WHO national TM policy guidelines and other related publications (\nWHO, 2019\nWHO, 2002\nWHO, 2013\nWambebe, 2009\nHeinrich, 2015\nAlostad et al., 2019\nDemeke et al., 2022\nThe homogeneity of the legal basis and organization structure of THM-regulated institutions/offices are affected by government administration structures. Therefore, the researcher selected a sample frame randomly from stratified medicine and health regulatory offices based on the hierarchal level of regulatory offices and the responsibilities of TM regulatory activities. Accordingly, the registration and regulation of THM products are implemented by EFDA in collaboration with the Ethiopia Public Health Institute (EPHI) and other agencies found under the MoH at the federal level, and the regulation of THM (practices, practitioners, and premises) is enforced by RHRBs that are established under regional health bureaus at regional, zonal, sub-cities, towns, and woredas health office levels.\nAccordingly, in the case of city administration, the THM practices and practitioner regulation are implemented by EFDA offices of woreda administration under the supervision of city and sub-city administration levels of FMHACA offices. However, in the case of other regional states, the health and health-related services and product quality control authority or offices (HHRSPQCA/O) established under the regional health bureau and health offices of the zonal, town, and woreda administration levels were responsible for enforcing THM practices and practitioners’ regulations and registration. Additionally, two case teams (the health facility control case team and the health and health-related product quality control case team) are established under each health-related service and product quality control (HHRSPQC) and FMHACA authority or office. Based on this, the researcher randomly selected a sample frame from a stratified target population of federal and regional health sector administration levels of medicine and health regulatory authorities, directorates, offices, and case teams.\nFor the quantitative study design, all eligible individuals within the selected authorities, directorates, offices, and case teams who met the inclusion criteria were included. Additionally, a purposive sampling method was used to select key informants (KIs) from registered THM practitioners actively practicing in the selected zones, towns, and woredas of the Oromia region and Addis Ababa city. This approach ensured that the sample represented both regulatory personnel and experienced THM practitioners relevant to the study’s focus.\nAccordingly, a selected sample frame was composed; four directorates of EFDA were purposefully selected (product assessment and registration, licensing and inspection, product safety, and product quality assessment). Likewise, of a total of 11 regional health regulatory bodies (RHRBs), three (30%) RHRBs (Oromia, SNNPR, and Addis Ababa city) were randomly selected and included in the study.\nFurthermore, 30% of zonal and town-level health regulatory office administrations of Oromia and SNNPR regions and 30% of sub-cities and woredas-level health regulatory offices of Addis Ababa city were randomly selected for the present study. Consequently, the researcher consisted of 12 Zonal (seven from Oromia and five from SNNPR) and 14 Zonal Town (nine from Oromia and five from SNNPR) administration HHRSPQC offices or case teams for the study. In addition, the FMHAC offices case teams of four sub-cities and 14 woredas of Addis Ababa city administration were involved.\nThe selection of African countries used for comparison considered the literature availability in English, THM regulation status, and geographical proximity of each selected country to Ethiopia. As a result, three African countries, Ghana, Uganda, and Kenya, which scored more than 90%, 75%, and 20% on the reviewed checklist, respectively, were selected (\nSupplementary File 3\n). India and China were selected purposely due to having good status on THMs regulations. The checklist used in the review process was revised and edited to make it suitable for evaluating the content of the reviewed countries’ legal bases on THM regulatory activities.\n2.7 Study variables\n2.7.1 Independent variables\nAwareness and belief of respondents on THM regulation; Opinion of regulatory personnel about HM quality, safety, efficacy, rational use, storage condition, and THM regulation performance of regulatory offices; THM practices and product regulation plans, monitoring and evaluation, awareness, reporting trend, and sanctions applied to THM-related problems; and Performance of regulatory offices on THM practical regulation were included under independent variables.\n2.7.2 Dependent variables\nPolicy, legislation, and regulation; system and structure for THM regulatory activities; and THM regulatory and implementation outcomes were included as dependent variables.\n2.8 Data quality assurance\nTo ensure the quality and reliability of data collection tools, a thorough review and revision process was undertaken, focusing on the legal and practical aspects of THM regulation. This process included adapting tools to reflect the specific regulatory context of THM. Language experts translated the interview questionnaires for THM practitioners into Afan Oromo and Amharic, the local languages, to ensure understanding. These translations were then back-translated into English by different experts to verify consistency and accuracy. High-quality data collection was further ensured by using well-designed, refined, and pre-tested tools. During data collection, data controllers assigned codes to each respondent to ensure the confidentiality of the respondents and the organization. Six pharmaceutical quality assurance experts (SD, REU, YTM, GH, DK, and SS) and one expert from the medicine registration and licensing departments (FH) collaborated to validate the final tools, bringing their combined expertise to enhance data quality assurance. This rigorous validation process solidified the reliability and alignment of the tools with the study objectives, ultimately strengthening the credibility and validity of the research findings.\n2.9 Data analysis and presentation\nRegarding the archival review, the first secondary data of different legal bases of those selected countries were extracted into pre-prepared tables in Microsoft Word 10. Then, the extracted data were analyzed to determine the presence of legal provisions for selected key parameters. Finally, the archival review findings data were summarized and presented in tabulate and text format for each reviewed country in a descriptive way under the topic selected for the review. The quantitative data were analyzed by organizing the collected questionnaire data after checking for completeness, consistency, categorization, and coding. Then, the organized data were entered into Epi-data manager version 4.6. Data were exported and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 26.0 software. The data were analyzed in descriptive statistics. Finally, the analyzed data outputs were presented in text, table, and figure form.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe researcher maintained awareness of ethical considerations during the study. Prior to starting data collection, the researcher obtained ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Jimma University with reference number JHRPG/912/2021G.C. and a letter of cooperation from the school pharmacy. Then, a formal letter of cooperation was received from the relevant administrative bodies of the institutions selected for study. In addition, official informed consent was requested from each study participant during data collection by explaining the objective of the study to respondents. Furthermore, the participants were encouraged as they participated voluntarily, ensuring that the information they provided was only used for the study purpose.\n3 Results\n3.1 Result summary of the archival review\nOverviews of THM policy, proclamation and regulation, administration structure and regulation framework, TM product MA, THM practice and provider regulation, TM/THM education, and health insurance status in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, India, and China are presented in\nTables 1\n. The results obtained from the archival review showed that the Ethiopian TM policy is integrated into the national drug policy of 1993, and Proclamation No. 1112/2019 of EFDA is a national law for TM products. Agencies and TM divisions under the MoH and Regional Health Regulatory bodies (RHR) bodies under regional health offices enforce TM regulation holistically with conventional medicine (CM) under one umbrella by the same allopathic professionals. TM/HM is defined as medicine in Proclamation No. 1112 on Article 2/9, whereas the definitions of TM/THM practice and practitioner are not addressed in this proclamation.\nTable 1\n. Overview of current policies, laws, and regulations of selected countries on TMs.\nEthiopia has prepared a draft of exclusive TM policy and proclamation, guidelines for TM MA, and different TM product directives. HM products are regulated exclusively as a category of TM products with exclusive GMP and safety requirements. The only pathway for TM products is market authorizations (MAs), and there is as yet no registered TM product in Ethiopia. TM products are not included in the post-market surveillance system. Regulating TM products based on their claims and legally binding national pharmacopeia and monographs for HMs does not exist in Ethiopia. Furthermore, Ethiopia has legal provisions for TM products, market regulation, clinical trials, and promotion and advertising. Only indigenous TM practices and providers that are regulated under the regional level of the health regulatory division are available in Ethiopia. Currently, TM practices and providers are regulated by regional TM directives, and there is no national TM proclamation. Registration and licensing systems for TM healers are implemented in some regional states.\nSome regional states do not have an advisory committee for TM practices and provider regulation. Regarding THM education, Ethiopia has no clear education policy for TM, and at university, only it provides a single course. In Ethiopia, there is no health insurance coverage for TM at all. The system of TM practices integration with the national healthcare system is now at a nascent stage. There is no means of encouraging the quality of THM practices other than periodic inspection. The summary results are presented in\nTables 1\n3.2 Archival review of the legal basis of Ethiopia and five other countries\nTo evaluate the contents of the TM/HM law of Ethiopia, the study attempted to review the national medicine laws or acts of five selected countries (Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, India, and China) (\nTable 1\n). The review examined several key areas in TM/HM regulation, including policies, laws, and regulations specific to THM; the national framework for administering TM and THM; and the regulation of TM and herbal medicine (HM) products, as well as THM practices, providers, education, and health insurance-related legal foundations. The archival review revealed that Ethiopia’s TM policy was integrated into the National Drug Policy of 1993, with a dedicated TM policy drafted but not yet implemented. Enforcement of laws and regulations is primarily managed by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Health and Health-Related Service and Product Quality Control (HHRSPQC) or the Food, Medicine, and Healthcare Administration and Control Authority (FMHACA) through regional and lower-level health administration offices. In contrast, some other regions selected for comparison have shown strong initiatives to establish independent regulatory agencies for more robust enforcement of T/HM regulations.\n3.3 National framework for TM/THM administration structure and regulation\nAs depicted in\nTable 2\n, there are herbal medicine governing bodies, including practitioners and practitioners. However, government and public research funding for THM &CM in most reviewed countries was not clear.\nTable 2\n. National framework for TM/THM &CM administration and regulation in Ethiopia and selected countries.\nIn Ethiopia, herbal medicine (HM) products are defined as medicines under the current national medicine law/act/proclamation. However, in other countries referenced in\nTable 2\n, HM products fall under varied definitions. The archival review indicates that the policies, laws, and regulations in these countries regarding TM and THM cover definitions, product regulatory bodies, and the regulatory frameworks for practices and practitioners that reflect promising progress in legislative and regulatory landscapes. Additionally, the studied countries had established national plans to integrate HM products into their healthcare systems. Although these developments are encouraging, the review underlines the need for further efforts to fully develop and harmonize regulatory frameworks for THM across these regions.\n3.4 Regulatory situation of TM/THM in Ethiopia and those selected countries\nA comprehensive overview of the regulatory landscape surrounding imported herbal medicine (HM) products in various countries indicates the contrasting situation in Ethiopia. Although Kenya, Ghana, Uganda, India, and China have established clear legal regulations to govern the importation of HM products, Ethiopia’s regulatory framework remains ambiguous and needs further investigation based on evidence (\nTable 3\n). A notable disparity between Ethiopia and the countries mentioned in the study was the absence of a legal framework for post-market surveillance of safety concerning veterinary herbal medicine products in Ethiopia. The lack of a regulatory system for monitoring the safety and efficacy of imported herbal medicine products raises significant concerns regarding their quality and the potential for adverse effects. Without an effective mechanism to oversee these products post-market, there is an increased risk to public health, as unregulated herbal medicines may not meet necessary safety standards or could lead to harmful outcomes for consumers.\nTable 3\n. Regulatory situation of herbal medicine (HM) products in Ethiopia and selected countries.\nCompared to Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, India, and China, Ethiopia’s implementation of legal provisions for imported HM products was notably inadequate. This suggests that Ethiopia may be lagging in terms of ensuring the safety and efficacy of these products, potentially putting consumers at risk. Further details on the remaining regulatory circumstances surrounding herbal medicines in Ethiopia are presented in\nTable 3\n. The study outlines additional gaps in the country’s regulatory framework, shedding light on areas that require improvement to ensure the safe and effective use of imported HM products (\nTable 3\n3.5 TM/HM and CM practice, providers, education, and health insurance regulatory framework\nAs can be seen in\nTable 4\n, the regulation of TM/HM providers and practices was solely governed by the draft current national law, act, or proclamation. However, Kenya, Ghana, Uganda, India, and China have implemented regulatory frameworks to oversee the regulation of herbal medicine. Additionally, there are no national regulations or directives but rather some regional- and state-level practice regulations for TM/HM providers in Ethiopia.\nTable 4\n. Overview of T&CM practice, providers, education, and health insurance regulatory framework in Ethiopia and selected countries.\n3.6 Quantitative results from regulatory personnel\n3.6.1 Demographic characteristics of respondents\nThe study involved a total of 237 regulatory personnel (\nSupplementary File 4\n). Most participants were male individuals (75.5%), pharmacists (66.2%), and held first degrees (83.1%). The participants were from different regulatory offices, namely EFDA (57), Oromia RHR offices (58), SNNPR RHR offices (41), and Addis Ababa RHR offices (81). On average, the respondents had 4.1 ± 2 years of experience in regulation, and 139 (58.6%) had ≤4 years of experience.\n3.6.2 Survey on awareness and opinions regarding THM legislation and practices\nThe study involved 237 individuals, focusing on their awareness and opinions concerning traditional herbal medicine (THM) legislation and practices. Approximately 79.7% of participants demonstrated awareness of the THM-related content in the current legislation. Additionally, only 65 respondents (34.4%) believed that the legislative content on THM was comprehensive and adequate. Regarding public health concerns, a significant majority (81.0%) of participants believed that the current methods of preparation and practice of THM practitioners could lead to severe public health issues. Furthermore, about 81.8% of respondents were aware that THM practices and product regulations were intended to protect the public from health problems. The study found that 82.3% of participants reported not receiving any training on THM regulations. Moreover, regarding government commitment, most participants (73.8%) believed that the government showed strong commitment and support for regulating THM (\nTable 5\nTable 5\n. Awareness and belief of respondents on THM regulation, Ethiopia, 2022, (n = 237).\nThe study indicates an important finding about knowledge gaps in THM practices and preparation among participants. The finding revealed that around 51.9% of participants lacked sufficient knowledge, and 36.7% of respondents demonstrated medium knowledge. This distinction may imply that a significant portion of participants have limited understanding regarding herbal medicine practice and product preparation (\nFigure 1\nFigure 1\n. Percentage levels of respondents’ knowledge of THM practices and product preparation.\nAs shown in\nFigure 2\n, about 51.9% of regulatory personnel had a weak awareness of herbal medicine regulation, suggesting significant gaps in knowledge and understanding. Only 24.5% exhibited a medium level of awareness, showing a partial understanding but not comprehensive familiarity with the regulations.\nFigure 2\n. Respondents’ rate of awareness of THM regulation in Ethiopia.\n3.6.3 Regulatory personnel on HM quality, safety, efficacy, rational use, and storage conditions of THM regulations\nOf 237 study participants, most (57.8%, 51.9%, 54.0%, 58.2%, and 59.9%) respondents believed the traditional herbal medicine practice, safety, efficacy, quality, and HM rational uses in Ethiopia were not good, respectively (\nTable 6\n). The study’s findings revealed significant gaps in practices surrounding traditional herbal medicine (THM) among respondents, with only a small fraction demonstrating good quality control practices. An overall mean of 49.8% of respondents scored the system poorly in key areas such as safety, efficacy, quality, rational use, and storage conditions. These results indicate widespread concerns about the current standards in the THM market. Furthermore, the low percentage (6.8%) of respondents with good quality control practices underlines the urgent need for improved guidelines and educational initiatives to ensure that THM products meet safe and effective standards.\nTable 6\n. Opinion of respondents on safety, efficacy, quality, rational use, and storage condition of THM currently available on the market, Ethiopia, 2022 (n = 237).\n3.6.4 Regulatory performance of EFDA and regional health regulatory bodies on practical implementation of THM regulatory activities\nThe study assesses the regulatory performance of personnel working in federal and regional offices, particularly focusing on their implementation of THM product regulation and practical implementation of regulatory activities. At the federal level, approximately 70.2% of the Ethiopian Food and Drug Administration (EFDA) regulatory personnel rated their authority’s overall performance in THM regulatory activities as weak (\nFigure 3\n). Only 14% of federal-level regulatory experts demonstrated good regulatory performance in handling herbal medicine product regulations. For regulatory experts working at regional health regulatory offices, the findings also reveal notable performance gaps. About 41.7% (75 of 180) of regional regulatory personnel reported weak performance in implementing THM regulatory activities, while only 21.6% of participants rated their implementation practices as good (\nFigure 4\n). These results underline significant gaps in the regulatory workforce’s effectiveness in managing THM product regulation, both at the federal and regional levels, and highlight areas in need of improvement for effective regulatory oversight.\nFigure 3\n. Performance of EFDA regulatory personnel (n = 57) on practical implementation of herbal product regulation.\nFigure 4\n. Performance of regional health regulatory bodies on the practical implementation of THM regulatory activities, Ethiopia (n = 180).\n3.6.5 THM practices and product regulation plan, monitoring and evaluation\nIn this study, the regulation of THM practices was explored, with a focus on planning, monitoring, evaluation, and self-assessment processes within regulatory working environments. The findings indicated that 81.86% of participants agreed that a work plan exists for THM regulatory activities, ensuring a structured approach to regulating THM practices and products (\nFigure 5\n). Furthermore, most participants acknowledged the presence of monitoring and evaluation (63.7%) and reporting systems (68.4%) within THM regulatory activities, demonstrating foundational oversight mechanisms.\nFigure 5\n. Plan, monitoring, and evaluation system for THM regulation, Ethiopia, 2022 (n = 237).\nSelf-assessment processes were also recognized, with 53.6% of participants agreeing on their existence. However, nearly half (46.41%) of the participants disagreed about the presence of a self-assessment system for THM practices and product regulation, highlighting a significant gap in internal evaluation processes that could impact the effectiveness of THM regulation.\n3.6.6 Awareness, reporting trends, and sanctions applied to THM-related problems\nMost respondents who were aware of THM-related problems had not reported them to respective regulatory offices (\nSupplementary File 5\n). The\nSupplementary File 5\nshows that unregistered THM services rendering premises and unregistered practitioners were reported by 18.6% (37/199) and 18.6% (40/215) of participants, respectively. More than 50% of those reported THM-related problems are receiving sanctions from regulatory offices. Most study participants noted that legal and administrative sanctions are applied to the reported problems. Most respondents reported that the absence of a formal reporting system, lack of strong legal branches on TM, supposing the problem is not severe for public health, lack of evidence to report the problems, lack of public support, weak legal enforcement, and educative legal and administrative sanctions not applied by regulatory offices are the reasons for not reporting THM problems.\n3.6.7 Factors affecting the performance of regulatory offices on the practice of THM regulation\nMost respondents reported that a lack of research on HM (90.3%), a lack of appropriate mechanisms to regulate THM practice and products (87.8%), weak public support (86.5%), weak legislative enforcement (84.8%), human and financial resources constraints (84.4%), and inadequate basic THM regulatory tools (80.6%) (\nFigure 6\n) influenced the performance of the various regulatory offices.\nFigure 6\n. Factors affecting the regulation performance of medicine and health regulatory offices on THM practices, products, and practitioner regulatory implementation, Ethiopia, 2022 (n = 237). Note: QC Lab, quality control laboratory; MRA, Medicine regulatory authority.\n3.6.8 Challenges related to THM product, practice, and practitioner regulations\nAs can be seen in\nTable 7\n, respondents report that healers’ suspicions of and hesitancy to work with scientific communities (134, 56.5%), the inadequateness of current THM inspections using different regulatory tools (131, 55.3%), and the lack of scientific data for the safety, quality, and efficacy of some medicinal plants (129, 54.4%) were the major challenges of traditional herbal medicine products, practices, and provider regulation faced by the EFDA and regional health regulatory offices.\nTable 7\n. Challenges of regulating THM products, practices, and providers faced by EFDA and RHR offices, Ethiopia, 2022 (n = 237).\nAccording to the Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority and RHR personnel, there are several potential approaches to address the challenges in implementing and improving the regulation of herbal medicine. These include government support through the implementation of plans, strategies, and advocacies for traditional herbal medicine (THM), as well as providing training, financial resources, materials, and equipment for THM services. Additionally, it is important to establish formal clinical or service integration of traditional medicine (TM) within the national healthcare system and to offer formal, organized, supportive, and continuous training on THM practices. Furthermore, effective regulation should be implemented to control THM healers, and support should be provided for the establishment of strong national TM/THM associations and training institutions.\n4 Discussion\nThe study aims to evaluate the legislative and regulatory framework of Ethiopian traditional herbal medicines using a facility-based cross-sectional study and an archival review. Herbal medicine has a long history of traditional use in Ethiopia, where various plants have been used to treat ailments for generations. Despite its historical roots and widespread use among communities, the recognition and regulation of herbal medicine by national authorities in Ethiopia are still in development (\nTuasha et al., 2023\n). This lack of formal acknowledgment raises concerns about the safety and efficacy of these treatments (\nUsure et al., 2024\nDemeke et al., 2022\nThe existing evidence highlights several factors contributing to doubts about the quality, safety, and efficacy of traditional herbal medicine-based products, such as lack of standardization, limited scientific research, regulatory gaps, integration with modern medicine, and education and awareness (\nEruaga et al., 2024\nNoviana et al., 2022\n). Efforts to bridge these gaps include promoting research on herbal medicines, improving regulatory frameworks, and fostering collaboration between traditional healers and modern healthcare practitioners (\nMbwambo et al., 2007\nVan der Watt et al., 2017\n). These steps are critical to ensuring that the benefits of traditional herbal medicine can be safely and effectively integrated into the broader healthcare system in Ethiopia.\nThis comparative archival review examines the differences between Ethiopian traditional herbal medicine and other widely practiced regions such as Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, India, and China. The integration of Ethiopia’s TM/HM Policy into the national drug policy occurred in 1993, making TM products a part of the national legislation. Despite this, there are no registered TM products, no national pharmacopeia or monographs for HM products, and no defined education policy for TM (\nUsure et al., 2024\n). There is also no health insurance coverage for TM and limited collaboration between TM healers’ associations and regulatory authorities. This study highlights the varying stages of TM policy integration, regulatory frameworks, and education across the selected countries, with Ethiopia showing significant progress in drafting exclusive THM policies but still lagging in several areas, such as product registration, post-market surveillance, and education policy. Notable insights from other nations: Kenya and Uganda exhibit comparable integrated policies that encompass national frameworks for the administration and regulation of traditional medicine (\nUNESCO, 2021\nIn contrast, Ghana demonstrates a more sophisticated integration of TM within its national healthcare system, supported by specialized regulatory authorities (\nAmpomah et al., 2023\n; WHO, 2014–2023). Furthermore, India and China possess thorough legal frameworks and extensive regulations governing TM products and practices, which include well-developed educational systems and health insurance provisions for TM (\nFan et al., 2012\n; WHO, 2014–2023). The finding indicates a significant gap in the EFDA proclamation compared to the medicine acts of Ghana, Uganda, and Kenya. The review indicates that the medicine acts of these countries provide a more comprehensive definition of medicine based on its functions and sources and that they include detailed regulatory activities for traditional and complementary medicines (T&CMs), which might not be as explicitly outlined in the EFDA proclamation. Addressing these gaps could involve updating the EFDA proclamation to include clearer definitions and detailed regulatory frameworks for T&CMs, aligning more closely with the practices observed in Ghana, Uganda, and Kenya (\nGhana FDA, 2012\nNDA, 2021\nPPB, 2011\n). This could enhance regulatory oversight and improve the quality and safety of medicines, including traditional and complementary types, in Ethiopia.\nThe study showed that around 79.7% of the participants were aware of THM legislation. Out of those who knew, only 65 respondents (34.4%) believed that the legislation on THM-related matters was comprehensive and adequate. This indicated that the existing regulations were not adequate. A similar report from Tanzania indicated that awareness of regulations and tools used for regulating the T&CM operations among practitioners was generally very low (\nMujinja and Saronga, 2022\n). The respondents think that the current THM practices could lead to severe public health issues (81.0%). In a similar report from Uganda, most respondents were quite aware of the importance of TM in the sustenance of the healthcare system (\nGalabuzi et al., 2010\n). Additionally, 81.8% of the participants, which is about 157 of 192, were informed about the existence of regulations for THM practices and product safety to protect the public from such health risks.\nIn terms of government support, they perceive a strong commitment and support from the government in regulating THM (73.8%). This finding indicates the need for continued efforts to enhance the comprehensiveness and adequacy of THM legislation, address public health concerns related to THM practices, and ensure effective government support and regulation to protect public health. Furthermore, the study reveals critical information about the knowledge and awareness levels concerning traditional herbal medicine (THM) regulations. Approximately 51.9% of participants lacked sufficient knowledge about THM regulations concerning practices and preparations. The preparation of herbal medicines, particularly related to knowledge, was the primary focus of a report from North Gondar. This report corroborated the findings of the current study, emphasizing the significant role that traditional knowledge plays in the preparation and application of herbal medicines (\nAsmelashe Gelayee et al., 2017\n). In the current study, the awareness level regarding herbal medicine regulation was weak for 51.9% of the individuals, and a medium level of awareness was observed in 24.5% of the regulatory personnel. These findings suggest a significant gap in knowledge and awareness, both among the general participants and the regulatory personnel. This indicates a need for improved education and training programs to enhance the understanding and effective implementation of THM regulations.\nRegulatory personnel play a critical role in ensuring the quality, safety, efficacy, rational use, and proper storage of traditional herbal medicines (\nUsure et al., 2024\nDemeke et al., 2022\n). HM effectiveness depends on personnel’s solid awareness and active involvement in the herbal medicine regulatory landscape. In this study, approximately 59.8% of regulatory staff indicated that the rational utilization of THM products available on the market is inadequate. Furthermore, 33.8% of regulatory personnel highlighted that the quality of preparation techniques for HM by licensed traditional herbal medicine practitioners was poor. Additionally, 57.8% of respondents reported that the safety of THM practices was poor. In line with this study, a similar report from Tanzania reported that quality parameters with safety implications were not included in 48% of the active herbal substances (\nMssusa et al., 2023\n). Because the use of herbal treatments continues to raise serious safety concerns, it is essential that the proper regulatory bodies take the necessary steps to safeguard the public’s health by guaranteeing that all herbal medications are both safe and of suitable quality (\nEkor, 2014\n). Furthermore, 33.3% of respondents who work in regulatory offices reported that the storage conditions of HM at home for registered THMPs were inadequate. Properly scientifically sound storage conditions are critical for the shelf life of herbal medicine for safety and quality inheritance. The report from Kenya indicated that lack of acceptance/formal recognition by the relevant authorities, lack of representation, and poor harvesting and storage conditions were the main activities mentioned by practitioners (\nOkumu et al., 2017\n). The study presents a critical assessment of the Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority (EFDA) in terms of its performance in regulating traditional herbal medicines (THM).\nA significant majority (70.2%) of EFDA regulatory personnel believe that the overall performance of their authority in the practical implementation of HM (herbal medicine) product regulatory activities was weak. Out of a total of 180 RHR respondents, 41.7% of participants reported the weak performance of their regulatory offices in implementing THM regulatory activities. The high percentage of EFDA personnel acknowledging weak regulatory performance suggests significant gaps in the regulatory framework and its enforcement. As the study showed, the weak enforcement of regulatory frameworks could lead to the proliferation of substandard or unsafe herbal and modern pharmaceutical products in the market, posing serious risks to public health (\nBalkrishna et al., 2024\n). The EFDA still has flaws in controlling both herbal medicines and modern pharmaceutical products (\nSuleman et al., 2016\nThis study shed light on various aspects of traditional herbal medicine (THM) practices and product regulations, including the existence of monitoring and evaluation systems, self-assessment, work plans, and reporting systems. THM Practices and Product Regulation Plan, Monitoring, and Evaluation. The study participants agreed with the existence of monitoring and evaluation (63.7%), self-assessment (53.6%), work plan (81.9%), and reporting systems (68.4%) for THM regulatory activities. Despite the presence of these systems, 46.41% of respondents report a lack of self-assessment in THM practices, product regulation plans, monitoring, and evaluation. A significant gap exists in self-assessment practices among those involved in traditional herbal medicine (THM) regulations. Encouraging a culture of self-assessment and providing targeted training could help address this issue. By fostering a habit of regular self-evaluation, regulatory personnel can identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall effectiveness of their regulatory frameworks. Training programs could focus on teaching how to conduct thorough self-assessments and how to use the findings to make data-driven improvements in THM practices. This approach could help ensure that regulatory systems are more robust and responsive to emerging challenges (\nSaggar et al., 2022\nIn this study, awareness, reporting trends, and sanctions applied to THM-related problems were surveyed for forwarding regulatory recommendations, which are critical for identifying and reporting issues related to THMs. The study found that unregistered THM services rendering premises and unregistered practitioners were reported by 18.6% (37/199) and 18.6% (40/215) of participants, respectively. More than 50% of the reported THM-related problems received sanctions from regulatory offices. Most study participants noted that legal and administrative sanctions were applied to the reported problems. Most respondents reported the absence of a formal reporting system, a lack of strong legal branches on TM, supposing the problem would not have a severe effect on public health, lack of evidence to report the problems, lack of public support, weak legal enforcement, and educational legal and administrative sanctions not being applied by regulatory offices as reasons for not reporting THM problems. In Ethiopia, a similar issue has been observed where weak legal enforcement contributes to the underreporting of problems related to herbal medicines (\nDemeke et al., 2022\n). This issue reflects broader challenges in regulatory frameworks and public health management.\nEvaluating the factors that impact the performance of regulatory offices in regulating THM is essential for enhancing the efficiency of these regulatory entities. The study revealed that most respondents identified the lack of research on THM (90.3%), inadequate mechanisms for regulating THM practice and products (87.8%), limited public support (86.5%), weak enforcement of legislation (84.8%), constraints in human and financial resources (84.4%), and insufficient basic regulatory tools for THM (80.6%). It seems that Kenya faces similar challenges in herbal medicine regulation, with weak enforcement of legislation being a primary concern (\nOkumu et al., 2017\n). Addressing these concerns may involve increasing funding for research, developing stronger regulatory mechanisms, raising public awareness and support, strengthening legislative frameworks, and improving resource allocation (\nNg et al., 2022\n). These measures would contribute to enhancing the overall effectiveness of regulatory bodies in overseeing THM.\nThe study also aimed to identify key obstacles associated with the regulation of traditional herbal medicine (THM) products, practices, and practitioners. As per the findings, traditional healers were suspicious of collaborating with scientific communities and showed reluctance to engage with them. The primary challenges confronting THM products included the insufficiency of current inspections conducted through various regulatory approaches (56.5%), the absence of scientific evidence on the safety, effectiveness, and quality of certain medicinal plants (55.3%), and the need for improved procedures and oversight of providers, tasks that fall under the jurisdiction of regional health regulatory bodies and the Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority (EFDA). This urgent need calls for better procedures and oversight of providers, which are within the purview of regional health regulatory bodies and the EFDA. A comparable report emerged from Australia, highlighting the challenges associated with establishing a framework for acquiring the necessary evidence to validate traditional herbal medicinal products, as well as defining a regulatory system that ensures sufficient research funding and safeguards the resulting intellectual property (\nRoufogalis, 2015\n). This undermines the broader issue of integrating traditional medicine into regulatory systems while ensuring safety, efficacy, and quality.\n5 Conclusion and outlook\nThe study aimed to evaluate the legislative and regulatory framework for the enforcement of THM regulations in Ethiopia. The study revealed deficiencies in the EFDA declaration regarding the definition of TM/HM products and practices; uncertainty surrounding the names, authority, and duties of TM regulatory bodies; lack of clarity on the sources, types, and criteria for regulated TM products; and the necessary connections between TM regulatory entities. The study found that only 34.4% of participants reported that the legislative content on THM was adequate. There was also a lack of knowledge about THM regulations. Additionally, 51.9% of regulatory personnel reported weak herbal medicine practices. Reasons for not reporting THM-related issues included the absence of a formal reporting system, inadequate laws, a lack of evidence, and ineffective legal enforcement. Approximately 70.2% of regulatory personnel expressed that their authority in implementing HM product regulatory activities was insufficient. The main factors impeding regulatory offices in terms of THM regulation were inadequate research on THM (90.3%) and a lack of appropriate mechanisms for regulating THM practices and products (87.8%). Other challenges included healers’ hesitancy to cooperate with scientific communities (56.5%), inadequate THM inspections (55.3%), and a lack of scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of medicinal plants (54.4%), which were critical obstacles in regulating THM products, practices, and practitioners.\nFor improvements to the future roadmap, strengthening the legal framework, enhancing knowledge and capacity, improving research and evidence bases, developing robust reporting and inspection systems, enhancing public support, and legal enforcement are pivotal in the advancement of traditional herbal medicine legislative and regulatory frameworks. By undertaking these critical areas, the EFDA has the capacity to enhance the supervision of traditional herbal medicine products, techniques, and experts, thereby ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of herbal medicine-derived products.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/\nSupplementary Material\n; further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nAuthor contributions\nSD: data curation, methodology, validation, visualization, writing–review and editing, conceptualization, formal analysis, investigation, and software.

Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Naturopathy, except Allopathy. More than 70% of India’s 1.1 billion population still use these non-allopathic systems of medicine. Currently, there is no separate category of herbal drugs or dietary supplements, as per the Indian Drugs Act. However, there is a vast experiential-evidence base for many of the natural drugs. This offers immense opportunities for Observational Therapeutics and Reverse Pharmacology. Evidence-based herbals are widely used in the diverse systems and manufactured, as per the pharmacopoeial guidelines, by a well-organised industry. Significant basic and clinical research has been carried out on the medicinal plants and their formulations, with the state-of-the-art methods in a number of Institutes/Universities. There are some good examples. Indian medicinal plants also provide a rich source for antioxidants that are known to prevent/delay different diseased states. The antioxidant protection is observed at different levels. The medicinal plants also contain other beneficial compounds like ingredients for functional foods. Hence, the global knowledge about Ayurveda and Indian herbals will hopefully be enhanced by information on the evidence-base of these plants. This will yield rich dividends in the coming years.\nKeywords:\nAyurveda, Indian medicinal plants, reverse pharmacology, observational therapeutics, antioxidant\nIntroduction\nIndia has a very long, safe and continuous usage of many herbal drugs in the officially recognized alternative systems of health\nviz\n. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Naturopathy. These systems have rightfully existed side-by-side with Allopathy and are not in ‘the domain of obscurity’, as stated by Venkat Subramanian [\n]. Millions of Indians use herbal drugs regularly, as spices, home-remedies, health foods as well as over-the-counter (OTC) as self-medication or also as drugs prescribed in the non-allopathic systems [\n]. The more than 500,000 non-allopathic practitioners are trained in the medical colleges (>400) of their respective systems of health and are registered with the official councils which monitor professionalism. Hence, these systems are not folklore or traditional herbal practices. There are basic axioms of these systems leading to a logical and systematic structure of pathogenesis and diagnosis, which serves also as a determinant for therapy [\nThe developer of a potent natural product penicillin, Nobel-laureate Ernst Boris Chain wrote an inspiring article entitled “The quest for new biodynamic substances”. In 1967, he wrote, “In China and India there has been an extensive drive aimed at the systemic study of medicinal plants traditionally used in these countries in folklore medicine; this has failed, so far, to bring to light new classes of compounds with interesting pharmacologic activities. As far as drug research is concerned, therefore, we cannot expect many major surprises to come from the study of plant constituents” [\n]. The current overview would disprove the infallibility of this Nobel laureate, by giving examples of novel activities of Indian medicinal plants.\nObservational Therapeutics and Reverse Pharmacology\nIndia, having a pluralistic healthcare system, offers an unfettered choice for the quest for new clinical effects of traditionally used medicinal plants [\n]. Roy Chaudhary coined a neologism for such a discipline—Observational Therapeutics [\n]. He expressed his hope that further research directed at a few of the chronic diseases against which more drugs are needed, such as diabetes, bronchial asthma, could lead to the discovery of new drugs for these conditions. Observational Therapeutics is an antecedent of the path of Reverse Pharmacology for new natural drug development. Reverse Pharmacology was proposed and initiated by Vaidya [\n]. Reverse Pharmacology is possible only in those countries with pluralistic healthcare and where robust clinical and laboratory documentation of novel human, pharmacodynamic effects are possible by inter-system collaborative teamwork [\n]. India, at the national level, has adopted this approach of Reverse Pharmacology and also the golden triangular research for correlating the three fields by R & D network\nviz.\nmodern medicine, Indian systems of medicine, and life and pharmaceutical sciences [\n]. Reverse Pharmacology is defined as the science of integrating documented clinical/experiential hits, into leads by transdisciplinary exploratory studies and further developing these into drug candidates by experimental and clinical research. The identification of structures with novel biodynamic effects can also lead to new chemical entity path for drug development.\nThe scope of Reverse Pharmacology is to understand the mechanisms of action at multiple levels of biological organization and to optimise safety, efficacy and acceptability of the leads in natural products, based on relevant science.\nResearch Approach to Herbal Products\nThe path of Reverse Pharmacology, arising from Observational Therapeutics is complementary to other approaches for natural drug development (Fig.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nResearch Approach to herbal products (R & D Path for Natural Products)\nThe diversity of medical uses of plant is at times daunting for a new entrant to the field. But for a multidisciplinary research and a development network the options of research approach provide deep motivation for identification of new pharmacophores. Besides expanding the herbal therapeutic and preventive armamentarium, new pharmacophores may help to evolve new targets of drug action as well as a possibility for combinatorial chemistry on the novel pharmacophores. For example, curcumin has been a target molecule for a significant endeavour for a large number of combinatorial compounds. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), in India has initiated sizeable and meaningful efforts for the development of herbal-based formulations for diabetes, arthritis and hepatitis by a national network programme [\n]. The industry, the academia and the government research laboratories work in close collaboration. Interesting and novel activities have been detected with the selected plants and some of the active ingredients of therapeutically demonstrable effects e.g. glycaemic control and inhibition of HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) level coupled with a reduction in\nin vitro\nformation of Amadori products.\nThe diverse approaches to herbal drugs have led to interesting hits and novel activities, which need further in depth drug development efforts, both as herbal as well as new single molecule drugs.

The monographs and books in English are also available. But sometimes there are errors in translating the technical Sanskrit and Indian words into English. It is desirable that prior to embarking on developing any Indian herbal drug, the original Sanskrit textbooks or the experts and scholars of Ayurveda are properly consulted. There have been many scientific reviews on Indian medicinal plants too. Table\nlists some of the highly recommended books, monographs and reviews that can be used as per the needs of the reader [\n].

There has been no systematic review of the massive work that is available from this nation. Many international data-bases and web-sites do not cover even the work published in the Indian Journals. Hence, there is a global lack of awareness of the mass and nature of work carried out on diverse aspects\nviz.\nethnobotany, phytochemistry, pharmacognosy, pharmacology, clinical trials, safety studies and formulation-research.

There are many references to Indian medicinal plants and trade in spices in a number of historical documents. For instance, Indian aloe is very widely used in India for cosmetic, medicinal and nutraceutical purposes [\n]. But the antiaging effects of the pickled preparations are unique [\n]. Despite the global reputation of aloe in dermato-cosmetics, the potential as antiaging is still untapped. Similarly, the plant\nAdhatoda vasica\nhas been extensively studied for cough and the active principles have been known [\n]. However, the potential for use in bleeding disorders and tuberculosis is untapped. Table\ncites the clinical uses and the therapeutic potential of 14 selected Indian medicinal plants [\n]. There is a need for an international collaborative effort to explore, on a fast track, the hits provided by clinical observations of astute physicians.\nTable 4.\nUse and potential of selected Indian plants\nPlant name\nCommonest Ayurvedic usage\nReferences\nTherapeutic potential\nReferences\nAdhatoda vasica\nKasashwasaghna (Antitussive)\nAntituberculosis, Haemostatic\nAloe vera\nKushtghna (Skin diseases), Agnidagdha vrana (Burns)\nAntidiabetic\nBoswellia serrata\nShothaghna (Anti inflammatory), Grahaghna (Anti spasmodic)\nImmunomodulator\nCentella asiatica\nSmritiprada (Memory-enhancing), Kushtaghna (Skin diseases)\nAntiaging\nCurcuma longa\nPramehaghna (Anti-diabetic), Kandooghna (Anti pruritic), Vranapaha (Wound healing)\nCancer Prevention\nLeptadenia reticulata\nStanya (Galactogogue)\nAnticonjunctivitis\nMucuna pruriens\nVrushya (Aphrodisiac)\nAntiparkinsonism\nOcimum sanctum\nPratishyayahara (Anti cold)\nAnticancer\nPicrorrhiza kurroa\nKamalahara (Anti-jaundice)\nLipid-lowering\nPiper longum\nShwasakasahara (Anti asthamatic)\nAntimalarial\nPterocarpus marsupium\nMehaghna (Anti-diabetic)\nAntiinflammatory\nTerminalia chebula\nAnulomana (Mild laxative)\nMedhya\nTribulus terrestris\nAshmarighna (Litholytic)\nAntiprostatism\nTrigonella foenum-graecum\nMedoghna (Lipid lowering), Stanya (Galactogogue)\nAntidiadetic\nOpen in a new tab\nReverse Pharmacology on these selected plants may lead not only to new leads and drug candidates but also to novel targets and pharmacodynamic efforts. For example, investigations on\nColeus forskohlii\n, used as pickles in some parts of India, led to isolation of forskolin, with multifaceted effects. The latter were mediated by activation of adenylate cylase and increased concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [\n100\n]. Subsequently, forskolin (Fig.\n) has served as a very important tool in molecular pharmacology and endocrinology.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nForskolin (7β-acetoxy-8, 13-epoxy-1, 6β, 9-trihydroxylabd-14-en-11-one)\nThere are cAMP-independent effects of forskolin\nviz.\nthrough modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel desensitization, modulation of voltage-gated potassium channels, reversal of multidrug resistance etc. [\n]. This example suggests the complexity of effects of even simple phytomolecules. Hence, the emphasis has to be primarily on the human effect, as documented in Observational Therapeutics.\nIndian Medicinal Plants as a Source of Antioxidants and Radical Scavengers\nIn recent years, there is a tremendous interest in the possible role of nutrition in prevention of disease. In this context, antioxidants, especially derived from natural sources such as Indian medicinal plants and herbal drugs derived from them, require special attention. Antioxidants neutralize the toxic and ‘volatile’ free radicals. Antioxidants have many potential applications, especially in relation to human health, both in terms of prevention of disease and therapy [\n101\n102\n]. In biological systems oxygen gives rise to a large number of free radicals and other reactive species collectively known as ‘reactive oxygen species’ (ROS). Another group of reactive species are termed as ‘reactive nitrogen species’ (RNS) [\n103\n104\n]. In a normal healthy human, the generation of ROS and RNS are effectively kept in check by the various levels of antioxidant defense. However, when the humans get exposed to adverse physiochemical, environmental or pathological agents this delicately maintained balance is shifted in favour of pro-oxidants resulting in oxidative stress [\n101\n]. Cellular damage induced by oxidative stress has been implicated in the etiology of a large number (>100) of human diseases as well as the process of ageing. Various antioxidants may prevent and/or improve diseased states [\n101\n103\n105\n106\n]. These include the intracellular antioxidant enzymes and the dietary or oral supplements in the form of vitamin C, vitamin E, β-carotene, zinc and selenium [\n107\n108\n]. Antioxidants also can act at different levels of protection such as prevention, interception and repair.\nIndian medicinal plants provide a rich source of antioxidants. A review of literature shows that there are over 40 Indian medicinal plants showing antioxidant abilities at various levels of protection (Table\n). The medicinal plants that show significant antioxidant activity include\nAcacia catechu\nAchyranthes aspera\nAegle marmelos\n(Bengal quince, Bel),\nAglaia roxburghiana\n(Priyangu),\nAllium cepa\n(Onion),\nAllium sativum\nAloe vera\nAmomum subulatum\nAndrographis paniculata\nAsparagus racemosus\nAzadirachta indica\nBacopa monniera\nBauhinia purpurea\nBrassica campastris\nButea monosperma\nCamellia sinensis\nCapparis decidua\nCapsicum annum\nCentella asiatica\nCinnamomum verum\nCommiphora mukul\nCrataeva nurvala\nCrocus sativus\nCurcuma longa\nCymbopogan citrates\nEmblica officinalis\nEmilia sonchifolia\nGarcinia atroviridis\nGarcinia kola\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\nHemidesmus indicus\nHypericum perforatum\nIndigofera tinctoria\nMelissa officinalis\nMomordica charantia\nMorus alba\nMurraya koenigii\nNigella sativa\nOcimum sanctum\nPicrorrhiza kurroa\nPiper beetle\nPlumbago zeylanica\nPremna tomentosa\nPunica granatum\nRubia cordifolia\nSesamum indicum\nSida cordifolia\nSwertia decursata\nSyzigium cumini\nTerminalia arjuna\nTerminalia bellarica\nTinospora cordifolia\nTrigonella foenum-graecum\nWithania somnifera\nand\nZingiber officinalis\n109\n111\n]. There are also a number of ayurvedic formulations containing ingredients from medicinal plants that show antioxidant activities. These are Abana, Amrita bindu, C-phycocyanin, Centalaplus, Chapparal, Geriforte, Jigrine, Liv-52, Maharishi formulations, Muthu marunthu, Ophtacare, P55A, Sandhika, Student rasayana and Tamra bhasma. There are still a large number of plants and ayurvedic formulations whose antioxidant activities need to be examined in relation to their potential therapeutic and related beneficial properties. More recent assays also should be included to study the antioxidant properties of medicinal plants or their chemical constituents. This will greatly help in identifying more potent compounds with potential applications in prevention and/or therapy of human ailments. Newer approaches utilizing collaborative research and modern technology in combination with established traditional health principles will yield rich dividends in the near future in improving health, especially among people who do not have access to the use of costlier western systems of medicine.\nTable 5.\nIndian medicinal plants and levels of antioxidant action\nLevel 1: Suppression of radical formation\nCassia occidentalis, Crocus sativus, Emblica officinalis, Hemidesmus indicus, Indigofera tinctoria, Momordica charantia, Murraya koenigii, Ocimum sanctum, Picrorhiza kurroa, Sida cordifolia, Spirulina fusiformis, Tinospora cordifolia, Vinca rosea, Withania somnifera & Zingiber officinale\nLevel 2: Scavenging of primary radicals\nAcacia catechu, Aloe vera, Butea monosperma, Crocus sativus, Curcuma longa, Hippophae rhamnoides, Indigofera tinctoria, Momordica charantia, Ocimum sanctum, Plumbago zeylanica, Psoralea corylifolia, Rotula aquatica & Swertia decussata\nLevel 3: Scavenging of secondary radicals\nAllium sativum, Allium cepa, Aloe vera, Amaranthus blitum, Argemon maxicana, Asparagus racemosus, Azadirachta indica, Curcuma longa, Emblica officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hemidesmus indicus, Mangifera indica, Momordica charantia, Murraya koenigii, Ocimum sanctum, Onosoma echioides, Picrorhiza kurroa, Piper betel, Plumbago zeylanica, Psoralea corylifolia, Sesamum indicum, Sida cordifolia, Swertia decussata, Terminalia bellarica, Tinospora cordifolia, Vinca rosea, Withania somnifera & Zingiber officinale\nLevel 4: Reconstitution of membranes\nAllium sativum, Aloe vera, Camellia sinensis, Curcuma longa, Argemon maxicana, Cassia occidentalis, Crocus sativus, Emblica officinalis, Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Vinca rosea, Withania somnifera & Zingiber officinale\nLevel 5: Repair of damage\nOcimum sanctum &, Hibiscus sabdariffa\nOpen in a new tab\nIndian Medicinal Plants as a Source of Other Beneficial Compounds\nThese medicinal plants are also important source of other type of beneficial compounds including the ingredients for functional foods. These functional foods promote better health to prevent chronic illness. Some ingredients that make food functional are dietary fibres, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, oligosaccharides, essential fatty acids (omega-3), lactic acid bacteria cultures and lignins. Many of these are present in medicinal plants. Indian systems of medicine believe that complex diseases can be treated with complex combination of botanicals unlike in the West, with single drugs. Whole foods are hence used in India as functional foods rather than supplements. Some medicinal plants and dietary constituents having functional attributes are spices such as onion, garlic, mustard, red chilli, turmeric, clove, cinnamon, saffron, curry leaf, fenugreek and ginger. Some herbs such as\nBixa orellana\nand vegetables like amla, wheat grass, soybean and\nGarcinia cambogia\nhave antitumor effects [\n112\n113\n]. Other medicinal plants with such functional properties include\nAegle marmelos\nAllium cepa\nAloe vera\nAndrographis paniculata\nAzadirachta indica\nand\nBrassica juncea\n111\n114\nConclusion and Future Prospects\nIn India more than 70% of the population use herbal drugs for their health. There is a vast experience-based evidence for many of these drugs. There are also a number of Institutes/Universities in India carrying our research on herbal drugs and medicinal plants. Using ‘reverse pharmacological’ approach, several Institutes carry out basic and clinical research on the potential health benefits of herbal drugs. There are many successful examples in this direction. These herbal drugs and Indian medicinal plants are also rich sources of beneficial compounds including antioxidants and components that can be used in functional foods. Newer approaches utilizing collaborative research and modern technology in combination with established traditional health principles will yield rich dividends in the near future in improving health, especially among people who do not have access to the use of costlier western systems of medicine.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Shridhar Anishetty and Mr. Rajkumar Mishra for their help in preparation of the overview.\nReferences\nVenkat Subramanian T.C.

    "content": "Ayurvedic Medicine: In Depth\nIs Ayurvedic Medicine Safe?\nSome Ayurvedic preparations may contain lead, mercury, or arsenic in amounts that can be toxic.\nIs Ayurvedic Medicine Effective?\nA few studies suggest that Ayurvedic preparations may reduce pain and increase function in people with osteoarthritis and help manage symptoms in people with type 2 diabetes, but most of these trials are small or not well-designed. There is little scientific evidence on\nAyurveda\nâs value for other health issues.\nHow much do we know about Ayurvedic medicine?\nAlthough\nAyurvedic medicine\nand its components have been described in many scholarly articles, only a small number of clinical trials using these approaches have been published in Western medical journals. About 240,000 American adults use Ayurvedic medicine.\nWhat Is Ayurvedic Medicine?\nThe ancient Indian medical system, also known as Ayurveda, is based on ancient writings that rely on a ânaturalâ and holistic approach to physical and mental health. Ayurvedic medicine is one of the worldâs oldest medical systems and remains one of Indiaâs traditional health care systems. Ayurvedic treatment combines products (mainly derived from plants, but may also include animal, metal, and mineral), diet, exercise, and lifestyle.\nWhat the Science Says About the Effectiveness of Ayurvedic Medicine\nFew well-designed clinical trials and systematic research reviews suggest that Ayurvedic approaches are effective.\nResults from a 2013\nclinical trial\ncompared two Ayurvedic formulations of plant extracts against the\nnatural product\nglucosamine\nsulfate and the drug celecoxib in 440 people with knee osteoarthritis. All four products provided similar reductions in pain and improvements in function.\nA preliminary and small NCCIH-funded 2011 pilot study with 43 people found that conventional and Ayurvedic treatments for rheumatoid arthritis were similarly effective. The conventional drug tested was methotrexate and the Ayurvedic treatment included 40 herbal compounds.\nOutcomes from a small short-term clinical trial with 89 men and women suggested that a formulation of five Ayurvedic herbs may help people with type 2 diabetes. However, other researchers said inadequate study designs havenât allowed researchers to develop firm conclusions about Ayurveda for diabetes.\nTurmeric, an\nherb\noften used in Ayurvedic preparations, may help with ulcerative colitis, but the two studies reporting this were smallâone, published in 2005, included 10 people while the other, published in 2006, had 89.\nWhat the Science Says About the Safety of Ayurvedic Medicine\nSome Ayurvedic preparations include metals, minerals, or gems. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that the presence of metals in some Ayurvedic products makes them potentially harmful.\nA 2015 published survey of people who use Ayurvedic preparations showed that 40 percent had elevated blood levels of lead and some had elevated blood levels of mercury. About one in four of the supplements tested had high levels of lead and almost half of them had high levels of mercury.\nA 2015 case report published in the Center for Disease Controlâs\nMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\nlinked elevated blood lead levels in a 64-year-old woman with Ayurvedic preparations purchased on the Internet.\nAlthough rare, Ayurvedic products may cause arsenic poisoning.\nNCCIH-Funded Research\nNCCIH is funding research that:\nBuilds on earlier investigations in breast cancer survivors that found a positive effect of integrated Ayurvedic medicine on improved quality of life; new research will evaluate ways to make this intervention easier to incorporate into peoplesâ lives. The proposed Ayurvedic intervention includes diet, lifestyle,\nyoga\n, and pressure point treatment.\nStudies the mechanism by which an extract from\nButea monosperma\n(BME) flowers may protect against joint destruction from osteoarthritis (BME is widely used in Ayurveda for arthritis and other inflammatory diseases in India).\nMore To Consider\nDonât use Ayurvedic medicine to postpone seeing a conventional health care provider about a medical problem.\nIf you have a health condition, talk with your conventional health care provider before using Ayurvedic products.\nThere is no significant regulation of Ayurvedic practice or education in the United States, and no state requires a practitioner to have a license. For more information on credentialing complementary health practitioners, see the NCCIH fact sheet\nCredentialing, Licensing, and Education\nIf youâre pregnant or nursing, be sure to consult your (or your childâs) health care provider as some Ayurvedic products may contain products that could be harmful.\nTell all your health care providers about any complementary or integrative health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care.\nFor More Information\nNCCIH Clearinghouse\nThe NCCIH Clearinghouse provides information onÂ NCCIHÂ and complementary and integrative health approaches, including publications and searches of Federal databases of scientific and medical literature.

Ayurveda means the science or knowledge of life, where ‘Ayur’ means life and ‘Veda’ means knowledge.\nThe Ancient and Traditional practice of Ayurvedic is 5,000 years old and works on three basic three principles or doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) and ayurveda practice is based on three classical texts – the Charaka Samhita, the Sushruta Samhita, and the Ashtanga Hridaya which were written in Sanskrit over 2,000 years ago and are collectively known as the Great Trilogy.\nAyurveda takes a holistic approach to health, focusing on lifestyle, diet, and natural substances. It is important to note that while Ayurveda is a recognised traditional system of healthcare in India, its treatments should be approached responsibly and under the guidance of qualified practitioners. Individuals are encouraged to consult registered medical professionals for the diagnosis and management of any medical condition\nThe Role of Ayurvedic Herbs\nAyurvedic herbs are an integral part of the Ayurvedic medicine system. Since ancient times, these herbs have been used to help manage different diseases, promote mental clarity, boost immunity, and support healthy skin. In Ayurvedic practice, attention is given to the person as a whole, addressing the mind, body, and lifestyle rather than focusing solely on the symptoms of a condition. A wide range of herbs are used in Ayurveda to treat illnesses, with active ingredients derived from leaves, roots, flowers, and bark. These herbs are selected with the intention of promoting internal balance and supporting the body’s natural functions\nManjistha, for instance, may be beneficial in managing bone-related conditions. A 2020 study found that the root of Manjistha contains a compound that may be effective as a phytomedicine in the treatment of bone disorders\nDr. Siddharth Gupta, B.A.M.S, M.D (Ayu)\nBenefits of Ayurvedic Herbs\nThe Ayurvedic system offers a traditional, holistic approach to wellness, focusing on balance and overall health rather than isolated symptoms. Some of the benefits of ayurvedic herbs are as follows:\nSupports the balance among the doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), which is considered important for overall well-being in traditional Ayurvedic understanding\nConsiders the individual as a whole, and any supportive measures used are selected with the aim of promoting general health, not solely addressing isolated symptoms\nCentres around lifestyle, diet, and plant-based preparations, and is considered by some to be gentler in its approach\nImproves vitality and provides strength, in line with the system’s holistic philosophy\nEmphasises maintaining internal balance, which is believed to help support the body’s natural defences\nSome of the Best Ayurvedic Herbs\nThe following ayurvedic herbs have been traditionally valued for their various properties and uses over many years. Below is an overview of some commonly known herbs and their traditionally associated benefits:\n1. Ashwagandha\nAshwagandha is a well-known herb in traditional Ayurvedic practice, used for various purposes over many centuries. The name ‘Ashwagandha’ is derived from Sanskrit, where\n‘Ashva’\nmeans horse and\n‘Gandha’\nmeans smell, suggesting, in traditional texts, the vitality and strength associated with a horse.\nIt is sometimes referred to as ‘Winter Cherry’ or ‘Indian Ginseng’, and is particularly noted in Ayurveda for its traditional association with supporting the body’s resilience and overall vitality. The roots of the Ashwagandha plant are commonly used in Ayurvedic preparations\n. The benefits of Ashwagandha are as follows:\nBoosts immune system\nDecreases stress\nHelps with memory and cognition\nImprove sleep patterns\nHelps to maintain normal testosterone levels in males\nMay improve fertility\nHelps improve heart health\nHelps improve thyroid health\nAshwagandha is a versatile herb and is traditionally available in various forms, including powders, tablets, and liquid extracts. It may be taken with or without food, depending on individual preference and practitioner guidance.\nCaution:\nThe use of Ashwagandha during pregnancy is not generally recommended unless under the supervision of a qualified medical professional. Individuals with thyroid-related conditions, particularly hyperthyroidism, should seek advice from a healthcare practitioner before using Ashwagandha or related preparations.\n2.

    "title": "12 Powerful Ayurvedic Herbs and Spices with Health Benefits",
    "content": "Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine. It aims to preserve health and wellness by keeping the mind, body, and spirit in balance and preventing disease rather than treating it.\nTo do so, it employs a holistic approach that combines diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes (\nAyurvedic herbs and spices are also an important component of this approach. They’re thought to protect your body from disease and offer a variety of health benefits, including improved digestion and mental health.\nHere are 12 Ayurvedic herbs and spices with science-backed health benefits.\nShare on Pinterest\nSoumitra Pendse/Shutterstock\nAshwagandha\nAshwagandha (\nWithania somnifera\n) is a small woody plant native to India and North Africa. Its root and berries are used to produce a very popular Ayurvedic remedy (\nIt’s considered an adaptogen, which means that it’s believed to help your body manage stress more effectively. Research has shown that it reduces levels of cortisol, a hormone that your adrenal glands produce in response to stress (\nThere’s also evidence linking\nashwagandha\nto lower levels of anxiety and improved sleep in people with stress and anxiety disorders (\nMoreover, research shows that ashwagandha may enhance muscle growth, memory, and male fertility, as well as lower blood sugar levels. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these benefits (\nFinally, there’s evidence that it may help reduce inflammation and\nboost your immune system\n, though more studies are needed (\n2. Boswellia\nBoswellia, also known as Indian frankincense or olibanum, is made from the resin of the\nBoswellia serrata\ntree. It’s known for its easily recognizable spicy, woody aroma.\nResearch suggests that it may be particularly effective at reducing inflammation by preventing the release of inflammation-causing compounds known as leukotrienes (\nHuman studies link\nboswellia\nto reduced pain, improved mobility, and a greater range of movement in people with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also help prevent oral infections and fight gingivitis (\nMoreover, it may improve digestion in people with\nulcerative colitis\nand Crohn’s disease, as well as breathing in people with chronic asthma, but more controlled human studies are needed (\n3–5. Triphala\nTriphala is an Ayurvedic remedy consisting of the following three small medicinal fruits (\namla\nEmblica officinalis,\nor Indian gooseberry)\nbibhitaki\nTerminalia bellirica\nharitaki\nTerminalia chebula\nTest-tube and animal studies show that\ntriphala\nmay reduce inflammation caused by arthritis, as well as prevent or limit the growth of certain types of cancer. However, studies in humans are lacking and more research needs to be done (\nIt may also function as a\nnatural laxative\n, reducing constipation, abdominal pain, and flatulence while improving the frequency and consistency of bowel movements in people with gut disorders (\nIn addition, a limited number of studies suggest that a mouthwash containing triphala may reduce plaque buildup, decrease gum inflammation, and prevent the growth of bacteria in the mouth (\n6. Brahmi\nShare on Pinterest\n– OhLanlaa/Shutterstock\nBrahmi (\nBacopa monieri\n) is a staple herb in Ayurvedic medicine.\nAccording to test-tube and animal studies,\nbrahmi\nappears to have strong anti-inflammatory properties. More human studies are needed to confirm these potential anti-inflammatory benefits are as effective as common NSAIDs (\nStudies also link it to improvements in learning rates, attention, memory, and information processing, as well as reduced symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, impulsivity, poor self-control, and restlessness (\nHowever, other human studies have shown mixed results on these benefits. Further research is needed (\nSome rodent/animal studies further suggest that brahmi may have adaptogenic properties, which means that it may help improve your body’s ability to deal with\nstress and anxiety\n. However, well-designed human studies are needed before strong conclusions can be made (\n7. Cumin\nCumin\nis a spice native to the Mediterranean and Southwest Asia. It’s made from the seeds of the\nCuminum cyminum\nplant, which are known for their distinctive earthy, nutty, and spicy flavor.\nSome animal studies show cumin to be beneficial in controlling blood lipids and protecting the liver from a high fat diet (\nPlus, cumin may protect against type 2 diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity. It may also protect against heart disease by increasing HDL (good) cholesterol while reducing triglycerides and LDL (bad) cholesterol (\nSome studies show bioactive compounds in cumin may have anti-inflammatory action, but these studies did not confirm any effects on diabetes, insulin sensitivity or heart disease (\nCumin likewise appears to possess antimicrobial properties that may reduce the risk of certain foodborne infections. Still, more studies are needed to confirm this (\n8. Turm\neric\nTurmeric, the spice that gives curry its characteristic yellow color, is another popular Ayurvedic remedy.\nCurcumin, its main active compound,\nhas powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties\n. Test-tube research shows that it may be equally or even more effective than some anti-inflammatory drugs — without all of their side effects (\nAlso, turmeric may help protect against heart disease, in part by\nimproving blood flow\nas effectively as exercise or certain pharmaceutical drugs (\nHuman studies suggest tumeric may improve symptoms of depression and anxiety (\nMoreover, compounds in turmeric may help preserve brain function by increasing brain levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Low levels of BDNF have been linked to disorders like Alzheimer’s and depression (\nThat said, most studies have used very large amounts of curcumin, whereas turmeric comprises only around 3% of this compound. Thus, amounts larger than those found in turmeric are likely needed to attain these health benefits, and such large doses may cause stomach upset (\n9. Licorice root\nLicorice root\n, which is native to Europe and Asia, comes from the\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\nplant and holds a central place in Ayurvedic medicine.\nTest-tube and human studies suggest that licorice root may help reduce inflammation and fight viruses and bacteria. It also appears to offer relief from a sore throat and promote oral health by protecting against dental cavities and\nCandida\nThis Ayurvedic spice may likewise help prevent or\nmanage heartburn\n, bloating, nausea, belching, and stomach ulcers. When applied to the skin, it may reduce symptoms of skin rash, including redness, itching, and swelling (\nHowever, the only studies on this root are generally small, and more research is needed to confirm these benefits.\n10. Gotu kola\nShare on Pinterest\nArnav Ray/Getty Images\nGotu kola\nCentella asiatica\n), or “the herb of longevity,” is another popular Ayurvedic remedy. It’s made from a tasteless, odorless plant with fan-shaped green leaves that grows in and around water.\nOne small study suggests that gotu kola supplements may improve people’s memory after they have had a stroke (\nMoreover, in one study, people with generalized anxiety disorder reported less stress, anxiety, and depression after replacing their antidepressants with gotu kola for 60 days (\nThere is also some evidence that the herb may help prevent stretch marks,\nreduce varicose veins\n, help wounds heal faster, and diminish symptoms of eczema and psoriasis. However, more research is needed (\nAnimal studies further suggest that this Ayurvedic herb may relieve joint pain, but more studies are needed to confirm this effect (\n11. Bitter melon\nBitter melon\nMomordica charantia\n) is a tropical vine closely related to zucchini, squash, cucumber, and pumpkin. It’s considered a staple in Asian cuisine and packed with nutrients and powerful antioxidants.\nResearch suggests that bitter melon may help\nlower blood sugar levels\nand promote the secretion of insulin, the hormone responsible for keeping blood sugar levels stable (\nIf you use insulin to manage your blood sugar levels, consult your healthcare before adding bitter melon to your daily routine to prevent your blood sugar levels from becoming dangerously low.\nAnimal studies further suggest that it may lower triglyceride and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, though human studies are needed to confirm this (\n12. Cardamom\nCardamom\nElettaria cardamomum\n), which is sometimes referred to as the “queen of spices,” has been part of Ayurvedic medicine since ancient times.\nResearch suggests that cardamom powder may help reduce diastolic blood pressure in people with elevated levels. (\nOne recent study states that inhaling cardamon essential oil helps with nausea in pregnancy (\nMoreover, older test-tube and animal research suggests that cardamom may help protect against\nHelicobacter pylori\nbacteria, which is a common cause of\nstomach ulcers\n, and may reduce the size of gastric ulcers by at least 50% or even eradicate them (\nStill, research in humans is needed before strong conclusions can be made.\nPrecautions\nAyurvedic herbs and spices are generally considered safe when consumed in amounts typically used to prepare or flavor foods. Yet, most of the studies supporting their benefits typically used supplements offering doses far exceeding that.\nSupplementing with such large doses may not be suitable for children, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with known medical conditions, or those taking prescripton medications.\nTherefore, it’s necessary to consult your healthcare provider before adding any Ayurvedic supplements to your regimen.\nIt’s also worth noting that the content and quality of Ayurvedic products are not regulated. Some Ayurvedic preparations may mix Ayurvedic herbs and spices with minerals, metals, or gems, rendering them potentially harmful (\nFor instance, a recent study found that 65% of Ayurvedic products studied\ncontained lead\n, while 32–38% also included mercury and arsenic, some of which had concentrations that were up to several thousand times higher than the safe daily limit (\n90,\nAnother study found lead in 65% of samples of Ayurvedic preparations, mercury in 38%, and arsenic in 32. In addition, 36% of the samples that contained lead and 39% containing arsenic had these elements in levels exceeding safe intake levels up to several thousand times (\nTherefore, those interested in Ayurvedic preparations should only purchase them from reputable companies that ideally have their products tested by a third party.\nThe bottom line\nAyurvedic herbs and spices have been an integral part of traditional Indian medicine for centuries\nAn increasing amount of scientific evidence supports their many proposed health benefits, including\nprotection against type 2 diabetes\nand heart disease.\nThus, adding small amounts of these herbs and spices may help both flavor your meals and boost your health.\nThat said, large doses may not be suitable for everyone, so make sure to seek advice from your healthcare provider before adding Ayurvedic supplements to your healthcare regimen.\nAnd remember, Ayurveda employs a holistic approach to health that also includes physical activity, adequate sleep, stress management, and eating a variety of fruits and vegetables daily."

    "title": "Nutraceuticals leading wellness in India",
    "content": "The nutraceuticals industry has been growing exponentially and has witnessed a boost due to the pandemic in the past few years. From wellness needs to beauty, nutraceuticals have taken over the healthcare industry with immunity boosting supplements. At present India has a 2 per cent share in the global nutraceuticals market with a market value of $ 4 billion and is expected to show a growth of $ 18 billion by 2025. With herbal exports at 47 per cent of production and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) increasing, the sector is opening growth opportunities.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has made health and wellness one of the most lucrative sectors. It has rapidly brought about a change in consumer lifestyle, boosted health consciousness, and increased the popularity of preventive healthcare mediums like nutraceuticals. India’s deep history in nutraceuticals have revolutionized Ayurveda for India, as nutraceuticals products are also derived from herbs, minerals, and other natural substances which boost immunity and help fight diseases.\nIndia is at the forefront of developing Ayurveda-inspired nutraceutical products today. Nutraceutical businesses have largely been developing products based on traditional Ayurvedic remedies and principles. These companies are achieving a lot of success in India in reaching the population with their high-quality wellness products. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his 87th edition of Mann ki Baat also lauded ‘Cureveda’, a Nagpur-based nutraceuticals company, for merging modern herbal research along with traditional Indian knowledge and promoting a holistic lifestyle. Furthermore, these companies are targeting sections of the population where nutritional needs are not fulfilled and are helping to eradicate the long-existing problem of malnutrition. For instance, according to statistics, 15 per cent of the population in India is undernourished while 73 per cent of Indians are deficient in proteins, and Indian nutraceuticals companies like Plix and fast&Up cater to these sections by providing rich in protein plant-based products which promote nutrition fulfillment in men, women, and kids.\nThe growth of the nutraceuticals industry in India can be attributed to various factors. Internet penetration in India has increased which has helped increase the visibility of nutraceuticals in the market. Companies have resorted to new and innovative ways of marketing their products since the advent of digitization and by diversifying the medium of products as capsules are increasingly being replaced by dissolving strips, dissolving tablets, and powders. Growing demand in the nutraceuticals industry is also due to the increasing awareness in people about their health and nutrition needs including growing knowledge of essential minerals and nutrients that help boost immunity. Moreover, nutraceuticals don’t have a bar on age and are easily available for all age groups.\nThe nutraceuticals industry in India paints a bright picture. The Indian economy is providing nutraceuticals businesses vibrant opportunities to discover, explore and develop new products with a combination of traditional knowledge and new technology, aiding the making of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat.’ The Ministry of AYUSH has also been supportive of the mission by assisting businesses to discover alternative medicine systems. However, further collaboration and support from the government can accelerate the sector's boom with focused manufacturing and regulatory policies. Support from the government and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) can also help the sector move ahead of certain limitations and achieve its full potential in the exports market.\nThe willingness in people to make healthier choices and to be healthy is only growing, owing to the pandemic. While people would earlier only rely on allopathic medicines to aid illnesses and diseases, now they increasingly also look at nutraceuticals in their daily routine to avoid the onset of pathological conditions. The nutraceuticals industry in India has gained a lot of traction under preventive healthcare which has become a necessity in today’s world and will rapidly grow in the future.\nThis article has been co-authored by\nIshita Sirsikar and Bhamini Rathore.\nSource\nhttps://fssai.gov.in/upload/media/FSSAI_News_Nutri_HealthCare_22_06_2021.pdf\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cureveda-of-mann-ki-baat-eyes-us-market-for-plant-based-nutraceuticals/articleshow/90693349.cms\nhttps://yourstory.com/2022/03/5-nutraceutical-startups-promote-holistic-wellbeing-oziva-plix-kapiva-plant-based-nutrition/amp\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/healthcare/wellness/advent-of-modern-nutraceuticals-from-the-roots-of-ayurvedic-medicine/2469574/\nhttps://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/trends-in-nutraceuticals-industry-in-india-and-outlook-for-2022/88884472"

    "content": "In a bid to popularize traditional Indian medicinal products and therapies in the domestic and global market and develop the country as a hub for such commodities and services, the Global Ayush Investment and Innovation Summit was conducted to highlight the possibilities for innovation, investment, and the scope for the sector’s growth via a knowledge-sharing platform and further initiate efforts to establish solution-oriented and robust technologies to utilize traditional Indian medicine. At the outset, the summit witnessed significant investor interest, policy discourse around key industrial challenges, and stakeholder meetings to lay emphasis on the promotion of alternate medicine in the country, making traditional medicines and medical practices more accessible and popular.\nThe summit resulted in an investment commitment of about INR 9,000 crore across major categories like FMCG, medical value travel (MVT) and services, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, technology, and diagnostics. During the summit, more than 70 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were signed between countries, prestigious research institutes, farmers' groups, and industry. The commitment is expected to generate over 5.56 lakh employment opportunities in the country. A significant highlight that took the forefront at the summit revolved around the need to utilize modern technology to validate the sector, while holding the foundational spirit of these practices in place. The Summit further aimed at initiating a dialogue around the opportunities for Ayush in boosting the Medical Value Travel to India. Special emphasis was further laid on the inclusion of medicinal plants in supply chain management.\nThe Ayush industry is booming with a strong global demand size of USD 657.5 Bn in 2020 and global exports of USD 31.0 Bn in 2019. The sector has shown immense growth over the past couple of years with a projected turnover of USD 20.6 Bn in 2022. The country’s MSMEs of this sector are catching up in terms of profits and research and development expenditures and the leading Ayush manufacturing states have successfully completed the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) reforms, including Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. These efforts have been materialised in an exponential rise in the recognition of Ayush as a system of medicine and wellness in India and the world, surging global demand for Ayush products and services, particularly since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to the growing domestic and global consumer preference for herbal products and herbs based medical treatments. The Indian domestic market of Ayush is estimated to be INR 500 crore, while exports amount to INR 200 crore.\nEvidently, Ayush healthcare services play an important role in the healthcare sector of our country and hold severe potential to channel the socio-economic dimensions of the country. Extensive research, training, and teaching are undertaken in each of the systems to facilitate their growth and contribute significantly to the public healthcare outcomes of the country. Thus, to further nurture the potential of this sector enough focus has been laid on facilitating a favourable ecosystem for startups and entrepreneurs. There exists a severe potential for young entrepreneurs and employment seekers in holistic healthcare and alternative medicine.\nThe Ayush Ministry is further exploring avenues to involve current students in a more inclusive way to build their careers in yoga, Ayurveda, and other traditional systems of medicine. These medical practices are required to be augmented with the current technology and target new market segments by using non-traditional means for outreach and distribution. This has been evident through the centre and state efforts to establish several educational institutes, hospitals, retreats, and wellness retreat centres focussing primarily on traditional medical therapies and alternative restorative medical practices. For instance, the proposed Ayush sports medicine centre1 to be set up in Mangalore, aimed at helping sportspersons in preparing diet plans, lifestyle management, injury prevention, boosting immunity, stress management, and body relaxation, is a welcome step in this context. In addition to this, the bill to establish an Ayush university2 in Tamil Nadu will further provide scientific validation and research to traditional medicines and practices.\nSuch efforts are envisaged to have a multi-fold impact on the current and future employment generation scope of the country. There is further scope for the youth in the existing and upcoming research centres and start-up opportunities. Moreover, with the conducive investment and business climate established for this sector, there exists high scope for future intervention in this regard, leveraging an incubator network and generating market access opportunities, particularly to incorporate technology and other scientific modes in the products and services offered by this sector.\nThis has been co-authored\nKarishma Sharma and Srijata Deb."

Revered by various civilizations for its remarkable properties, Aloe Vera's usage spans cultures and continents. The ancient Egyptians called it the \"plant of immortality\" and used it to treat wounds, infections, and skin ailments. Greek and Roman civilizations also recognized its healing potential, incorporating it into skincare and health practices.\nOver time, Aloe Vera's popularity persisted, finding its way into traditional medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Chinese medicine. Indigenous communities in various regions harnessed its benefits for different purposes, solidifying its reputation as a versatile natural remedy.\nNatural Remedies in Modern Skincare, Haircare, and Health Routines\nRecently, there has been a resurgence of interest in natural remedies, driven by a desire to reduce exposure to synthetic chemicals and embrace holistic approaches to self-care. Aloe Vera stands out as one of the frontrunners in this movement, offering many benefits without the potential drawbacks of harsh artificial ingredients.\nConsumers are increasingly drawn to Aloe Vera due to its potential to address a wide array of concerns gently yet effectively. This shift in preference aligns with the growing consciousness about the environment and sustainability. As individuals become more conscious of what they put on and into their bodies, Aloe Vera presents itself as a compelling option due to its inherent natural origins and diverse applications.\nThe Science Behind Aloe Vera\nAloe Vera's gel-like substance is packed with a complex array of nutrients, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds. This composition contributes to its multifaceted skin, hair, and health benefits. The gel's consistency and transparency are attributed to its high water content, making it an excellent hydrating agent.\nSeveral constituents in Aloe Vera contribute to its therapeutic effects. These include:\nPolysaccharides:\nAloe Vera contains long-chain sugar molecules that aid skin repair and hydration.\nVitamins:\nRich in vitamins A, C, and E, Aloe Vera offers antioxidant protection against free radicals, supporting skin and immune health.\nEnzymes:\nEnzymes like amylase and lipase assist in breaking down sugars and fats, potentially aiding digestion when consumed.\nMinerals:\nAloe Vera contains various minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc, vital for various bodily functions.\nAnthraquinones:\nThese compounds provide Aloe Vera with its natural laxative properties, making it a part of some digestive health regimes.\nAloe Vera for Radiant Skin\nMoisturizing Properties and Hydration Benefits\nAloe Vera's gel boasts exceptional moisturizing capabilities. Its high water content penetrates the skin deeply, providing intense hydration without clogging pores. This makes it suitable for various skin types, including dry and sensitive skin. Regular use can leave the skin supple, soft, and visibly plumper, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\nSoothing and Anti-Inflammatory Effects on Skin Irritations\nAloe Vera's anti-inflammatory properties relieve various skin irritations, such as sunburn, rashes, and allergic reactions. The gel's cooling sensation calms redness and inflammation while its nutrients promote the skin's natural healing process. It acts as a natural barrier, protecting the skin from further damage and soothing discomfort.\nPotential for Acne Prevention and Treatment\nAloe Vera can be a valuable ally for those dealing with acne-prone skin. Its antimicrobial properties help combat acne-causing bacteria, while its non-greasy texture won't exacerbate oily skin. Aloe Vera's ability to unclog pores and reduce inflammation can contribute to a clearer complexion over time.\nAiding in the Healing of Wounds and Burns\nAloe Vera's historical use in treating wounds and burns finds validation in its modern applications. Its combination of vitamins, enzymes, and polysaccharides accelerates healing by stimulating cell regeneration and collagen production. Aloe Vera's natural antiseptic properties further reduce the risk of infection, making it an indispensable component of first-aid kits.\nRevitalizing Hair with Aloe Vera\nNourishing the Scalp and Promoting Hair Growth\nAloe Vera's benefits extend beyond skincare to hair care.

Aloe Vera can aid digestion by promoting a healthy gut environment when consumed internally. Its enzymes support the breakdown of food, easing the digestive process and potentially alleviating issues like bloating and indigestion.\nBoosting the Immune System with Antioxidants\nThe antioxidants present in Aloe Vera, including vitamins C and E, contribute to a strengthened immune system. These antioxidants neutralize harmful free radicals that can otherwise damage cells and tissues, helping to maintain overall health and well-being.\nManaging Blood Sugar Levels and Potential Implications for Diabetes\nEmerging research suggests that Aloe Vera may assist in managing blood sugar levels. Compounds like glucomannan help improve insulin sensitivity, potentially benefiting individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, anyone considering Aloe Vera for diabetes management should consult a healthcare professional to understand its appropriate use in their specific context.\nConsiderations for Safe Consumption and Potential Interactions\nWhile Aloe Vera offers promising health benefits, it's crucial to exercise caution, particularly with internal consumption. Some compounds within Aloe Vera, such as anthraquinones, can have laxative effects in high doses. Additionally, interactions with certain medications are possible. Consulting a healthcare provider before incorporating Aloe Vera into your diet is essential, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medication.\nChoosing the Right Aloe Vera Products\nVarious Aloe Vera products are available on the market, each catering to different preferences and purposes. When selecting products, choosing reputable brands that prioritize quality and purity is important. For skincare, look for products with a high percentage of Aloe Vera gel for maximum benefits. When considering Aloe Vera supplements or juices, choose certified ones and provide clear dosage instructions.\nDIY Skincare and Haircare Recipes Using Aloe Vera\nIncorporating Aloe Vera into your self-care routine is simple. Many DIY recipes can be crafted at home using Aloe Vera gel as a base. From hydrating face masks to soothing hair conditioners, the possibilities are extensive. By blending Aloe Vera with natural ingredients like honey, coconut oil, or essential oils, you can create customized treatments that cater to your unique needs.\nFrequency of Use and Potential Side Effects\nThe frequency of Aloe Vera use varies depending on the product and individual factors. For topical applications, daily use of Aloe Vera gel can be gentle enough for most skin types. However, monitoring your skin's response is essential to avoid adverse reactions. When consuming Aloe Vera internally, moderation is key to prevent laxative effects. If you experience any discomfort or adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.\nEmbrace the Health Benefits of Aloe Vera\nIn a world where nature's secrets continue to captivate us, Aloe Vera emerges as a timeless ally for radiant skin, revitalized hair, and overall well-being. Its journey from ancient civilizations to modern wellness routines is a testament to its enduring efficacy. As science and tradition converge, we uncover the multifaceted benefits of Aloe Vera, spanning from its moisturizing prowess to its potential impact on health.\nWith its natural healing properties, Aloe Vera is a beacon of hope for those seeking a holistic approach to self-care. From addressing skin irritations and promoting hair growth to potentially supporting digestive health and bolstering the immune system, Aloe Vera's potential is as diverse as the earth from which it springs.\nReady to embark on a journey of transformation?

Handa \n\nSenior Specialist, \nEarth Environment and Marine Sciences & Technologies, UNIDO \n\nSeptember 10, 2006, Mohal-Kullu, H.P. \n\nAnbout Prof. S.S. Handa \nEx-Director, RRL-Jammu (CSIR) and formerly Professor and Head of the University Institute of Pharmaceutical \nSciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh; \nPresently Senior specialist Industrial utilization of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, \nEarth Environment and Marine Sciences & Technologies United Nations Industrial Development Organization \n(UNIDO) \nInternational Centre for Science & High Technologies \nArea Science Park, Padriciano 99. 34012 Trieste, Italy. \n(Permanent residence: C-522A, Sushant Lok-1,Gurgaon – 122 002) \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPandit Govind Ballabh Pant Memorial Lecture \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe economic value and future potential of the biological resources of a country are \n\ngetting redefined in the wake of the newly emerging international trade regulations from \n\na system, held over countries, where these resources were viewed as global heritages, \n\nthey are now being treated as invaluable reserves for the future of the country with an \n\nuntapped economic potential. Unlike that for physical resources, we do not have yet a \n\nsystem of defining 'biological resource holdings' of a country and consequently there is \n\na greater chance of these resources leaking out to other countries even before their \n\npotentiality is realized by the host countries. Thus there is an urgent need for developing \n\ninventory systems (qualitative and quantitative) that help defining the biological holdings \n\nof a country. Databases and documenting systems of biological resources of a country \n\nare useful in conservation, commercialization and in establishing the patent rights. The \n\nGovernment of India has taken timely initiatives in establishing National Bioresource \n\nDevelopment Board (NBDB) which is taking requisite measures to take care of our \n\nbioresources and GB Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development has \n\nbeen playing a very active role with respect to MAPs by not only maintaining gene \n\nbanks but making appropriate selection of rich strains for commercial exploitation. I \n\ntherefore, \n\ngreatly appreciate the efforts of all the members of the institute and on this gracious \n\noccasion I congratulate them for their contributions in the national endeavour. \n\nOur country is among 12 leading biodiversity centres of the world with 45,000 plant \n\nspecies in 16 agroclimatic and 10 vegetative zones. We have 18,000 flowering plants, \n\n44% of which are of medicinal significance. These medicinal plants are the richest \n\nresource of our traditional medicines, phytopharmaceuticals, modern allopathic drugs, \n\nhousehold remedies and nutraceuticals. The use of phytopharmaceuticals is increasing \n\nat the rate of 15 percent annually. Global market is booming for MAPs and their \n\nproducts. Our contributions in the world market are not significant. Therefore, we need \n\nto look seriously on various issues, problems and technologies. The problems include \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fQuality parameters not being \n\nfollowed, unregulated \n\ntrade, nearly 90 percent \n\ndependence on natural resources, agro-practices, post-harvest and post gathering \n\npractices are not appropriate, storage conditions deplorable leading to inconsistency in \n\nquality. The issues which need to be addressed include regulatory especially \n\nregistration of herbal products, non-existent nutraceutical regulations, unregulated \n\nmedicinal plant extract industry, safety aspects etc. We need to strengthen agro, post \n\nharvest, grinding, extraction of plants, isolation of phytoconstituents, formulation \n\ntechnologies. Extensive use of qualitative and quantitative techniques for quality \n\nassurance. Some of the leads obtained in medicinal plants by Indian scientists will be \n\nhighlighted and certain current needs and developments in medicinal plant based \n\nproducts shall be discussed. Some of these would include Phytosome herbal drug \n\ndelivery, raw material for synthetic drug tamif1u (birdf1u H5N1 virus), polysaccharides as \n\nsafer therapeutics and for other industrial uses, promoting Indian gums through \n\nscientific inputs, sugar substitutes having least caloric values, improving quality of plant \n\npurgatives, chemotypes of medicinal significance, organic farming for Pharma products, \n\nenzymes such as phytases, systems biology, roadmap to safe, efficacious, quality \n\nassured and scientifically validated herbal drugs and plant derived allopathic drugs. \n\nAromatic plants for global volatile oil production will be also discussed. Some of the \n\npriority disease areas such as protozoal diseases (like malaria, filarial, leishmania), \n\ncancer, rheumatic diseases, diabetes, bronchial asthma, viral diseases, liver disorders \n\nand mental disorders where medicinal plants can play a crucial role have been \n\ndiscussed. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n\f1. Tribute \n\nIt is indeed an honour and privilege to be asked to deliver the Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant \nmemorial lecture. On this occasion I would like to pay my homage to revered Pandit Govind Ballabh \nPant, a great son of India, an enlightened, visionary and inspiring leader, statesman par excellence and \nfreedom fighter of our country. Bharat Ratna Shri Govind Ballabh Pant’s contributions to the nation are \nimmense and monumental. Being one of the chief architects of free India, he held many prestigious \npositions including those of the Chief ministership of Uttar Pradesh and Home Ministership of the \ncountry. He hailed from Himalayan region and the Government of India has very rightly established an \ninstitute, in his cherished memory, on the occasion of his birth centenary year (1987-88), called the \nGovind Ballabh Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development at Almora. All his life, \nPandit Pant was in close contact with people and had great concern for their well being. \n\n2. Glimpse of Himalayan Drug Plants \n\nAs Himalayan region is one of the richest repositories of medicinal and aromatic plants which contribute \nimmensely to the drug-armamentarium of all the traditional systems of medicines and modern \ntherapeutics, it is with this background that I have chosen the topic “medicinal plants for health care”. \n\nThe Himalaya has been fountain head of yogic wisdom and spirituality of millions of Indians, not \nwithstanding their differing religious beliefs. The mountain chain has influenced the life, culture and \nhistory of India. The holy epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata carry excellent descriptions of 2800 km \nlong Himalayan belt occupying an area of about 591,000 sq. km (18% of India) inhibited by nearly 52 \nmillion people covering 12 states including union territories. \n\n________________________________________________________________________ \n\n* Senior specialist Industrial Utilization of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, United Nations Industrial \n\nDevelopment Organization, International Centre for Science & High Technology, Area Science Park, \nPadriciano 99, 34012 Trieste, Italy \n\nTo save the life of Lakshman, the younger brother of Lord Rama, Hanuman travelled to the Himalaya in \nsearch of Sanjiwani booti (life saving herb). Thus the Himalaya is well known for a whole range of \nmedicinal and aromatic plants some of which have gone into commerce and have their centre of origin in \nthe Himalaya. Among the important ones are Asparagus racemosus (galactagogue of Indian origin), \nAtropa belladonna (source of antispasmodic atropine), Aconitum heterophyllum (high value bitter tonic), \nBerberis species (one of the richest source of pharmacologically active alkaloid berberine), Colchicum-\nluteum (containing antigout colchicine), Coptis teeta (another source of berberine), Cymbopogon species \n(citral source for production α-ionone & β-ionone), Curcuma zedoaria (well established anti-\ninflammatory drug and wonderful wound healer), Digitalis purpurea, Digitalis lanata (both producing \ncardiotonic glycosides), Dioscorea deltoidea, D. prazeri, D. floribunda (very first and rich source of \ndiosgenin used for the synthesis of cortocosteroidal drugs), Ephedra geradiana (contains bronchodilatory \nephedrine used for the treatment of bronchial asthma), Gentiana kurrooa (hepatoprotective drug), \nHeracleum spp (source of xanthotoxin), Hyoscyamus niger (source of hyoscyamine and hyoscine), Inula \nracemosa (pushkarmool of Ayurveda for bronchitis), Mentha arvensis (commercial source of menthol), \nNardostachys jatamansi (tranquilizer and sedative), Orchis latifolia (for unspecified diarrhea in children), \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPapaver somniferum (source of analgesic morphine and antitussive codeine), Physochlaina praelta \n(commercial rich source of atropine and hyoscyamine), podophyllum hexandrum (source of \npodophyllotoxin for producing anticancer drugs etoposide & tenoposide), Picrorhiza kurrooa (drug for \nliver protection), Saussurea lappa (antidiarrheal, antiemetic & digestive), Swertia species (bitter tonic), \nValeriana wallichii (sedative and tranquilizer), Voila adorata (expectorant). \n\n3. Medicinal plants: well spring of Traditional and Modern drugs \n\nThe use of plants as source of medicinal agents lies deep in the roots of autiquity. No one will ever know \nwhat led primitive man emerging from his ancestral, origin, to select certain plant material for the \ntreatment of various ailments and diseases though it may be assumed that during the long transition from \ninstinctive behaviour to more rational action, there was a conscious realization that certain roots, leaves, \nbark, fruits and even plant exudations had some beneficial action. This knowledge and the characteristics \nof the plant material, or even the entire plant itself, would be remembered for future occasions and the \ninformation passed on to others by word of mouth. Later, as different civilizations developed, man was \nable to communicate his knowledge and ideas, first by carving into stones or clay and later by writing on \nparchment or paper with the result that his knowledge became known to the coming generations. \nReverence may be made to the clay writings from the library of the Assyrian king, to the Ebers Papyrus \nand to the writings of Dioscorides to indicate sources of our knowledge today about the crude drugs by \nArabians, Babylonians, Chinese, Egyptians, Greeks, Indians, Persians, Romans and Sumarians thousands \nof years ago. The oldest treatises dealing with Ayurveda are Susruta samhita and Charaka samhita both \ncompiled between 500-300 B.C. The development of the Ayurvedic system of medicine was based on \nscientific approach and methodology. Many of the drugs used in the traditional systems have stood the \ntest of time. \n\nWith the advent of European scientific methods, many of the reputed medicinal plants came under \nchemical scrutiny, leading to the isolation of active principles. Beginning with A.D. 1800 there was \ncontinuous activity in this area and many of the well known medicinal plants were chemically analysed \nand their active principles characterized. Soon after their isolation and characterization, these compounds \neither in pure state or in the form of well characterized extracts, became part of pharmacopoeias of several \ncountries. To cite well known examples reference can be made to ephedrine, morphine, quinine and \nemetine which still occupy an honourable place in pharmacies. The Chinese crude drug Ma Huang has \nbeen in use in China for over 5000 years for the treatment of fevers and respiratory ailments. Its active \ncomponent ephedrine was isolated in 1887 by Nagi and Hari in Japan. Detailed pharmacological work \nfollwed and the compound was introduced in western medicine in 1925 by Chen of Eli Lilly company. \nMorphine was isolated from opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) in 1804 by Sertuner and was introduced \nin medicine in 1818. Quinine isolated by Pelletier in 1820 from a Peruvian tree. Cinchona, was \nintroduced as an antimalarial drug in 1825. From a Brazilian medicinal plant Cephaelis ipecacuanha an \nactive principle emetine was isolated in 1894 and introduced in medicine in 1912. Thus pharmacists in \npharmaceutical industry started paying attention to the chemical constituents of drugs, especially aconite, \nbelladonna, cinchona, digitalis, ergot and opium. Morphine has given the organic chemists an interesting \nlead on which to base a large number of opioid analgesic drugs and the same may be said for the natural \ndrug quinine for numerous antimalarial drugs. Many new and useful drugs based upon these natural \nproducts are now available but they have not been able to replace effectively till today these two alkaloids \nin medical practice. \n\nIt has been estimated that from 250,000 to 750,000 species of higher (flowering \nplants) exist on earth; some of these have not yet been botanically described. Although \nthere is no way to determine accurately how many of these species have been used in \ntraditional medicine, a reasonable estimate would be about 10% or from 25,000 to \n\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f75,000 species. However, perhaps only about 1% of these are acknowledged through \nscientific studies to have real therapeutic value when used in extract form by humans. \nVirtually all such plants have been discovered and put to wide spread use in traditional \nmedical systems through information derived from their use in folk medicine, \nethnomedicine or traditional medicine. \n\nWorld population is 5 billion today and with this rate of growth it is likely to touch 7.5 \nbillion by the year 2020. Global estimates indicate that over 3/4th of the five billion world \npopulation cannot afford the products of the western pharmaceutical industry and have \nto rely upon the use of traditional medicines, which are mainly derived from plants. This \nfact is well compiled by W.H.O. in an inventory of medicinal plants list in over 20,000 \nspecies. As a part. of strategy to reduce financial burden on developing countries which \nspend 40-50% of their total health budget on drugs, W.H.O. currently encourages, \nrecommends and promotes the inclusion of herbal drugs in national health care \nprogrammes because such drugs are easily available at a price within the reach of a \ncommon man and as such are time tested and thus considered to be much safer than \nthe modern synthetic drugs. Resurgence of interest in herbal drugs in the western \nEuropean countries is evident from the fact that two volumes of British Herbal \nPharmacopoeia have been published and $ 33 million worth literature on herbal \nproducts was sold in the USA in 1990. The \"green wave\" in the utilization of medicinal \nplants \nrecently British Pharmacopoeia \nCommission and European Pharmacopoeia Commission both have decided to include \natleast 20 Ayurvedic Indian medicinal plants and 20 Chinese medicinal plants in their \nrespective Pharmacopoeias. International agencies like W.H.O., UNIDO and FAO are \npromoting the industrial use of medicinal plants in National Health care programmes of \nall countries. The current world trade in medicinal plants is nearly US$ 60 billion and as \nper world Bank estimates by the year 2050 this figure will touch US$ 5 trillion for \nmedicinal plants trade in the world. \n\nin higher consumption. Only \n\nresulted \n\n4. Medicinal Plants Based Drug Industries \n\nBusiness opportunities in the medicinal and aromatic plants sector are exponentially expanding due to \ndiversified uses of the plant derived molecules in pharma, cosmetics, nutraceuticals and agri-chemical \nindustries. A shift from the present mind set of collection and consumption to cultivation for utilization \nwill automatically ensure purity, authenticity and availability of MAPs for various end-user industries. \n\nMedicinal plant based drug industry has four major segments, viz. (i) plant drugs for Indian systems of \nmedicine covering Ayurvedic, Unani and Siddha systems, (ii) over the counter, non-prescription items \ninvolving plant parts, extracts and galenicals (iii) essential oils and (iv) phytopharmaceuticals. Medicinal \nplants as resource of drugs (see figure 1) \n\n4.1 Medicinal plants based drug industries in Indian Systems of Medicine \n\nThere are at present 8000 manufacturers of drugs for Indian Systems of Medicine. Besides, there are \nmany small manufacturing units using medicinal plants and thousands of Vaidyas preparing their own \ndrugs from various plants. Annual herbal drug production has been estimated at around Rs.5,500 \ncrores. Various bottlenecks in the Indian herbal drug industry have been discussed elsewhere 2. \n\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4.2 Plant parts extract and galenicals \n\nThe direct utilization of plant material is a feature of traditional medicines not only in the developing \nworld but also in Europe and the U.S.A. e.g. herbal formulations on health food shops. Preparations \nof decoctions, tinctures, galencials and total extracts of plants also form a part of many \npharmacopoeias of the world. The current trend of medicinal plants based drug industry is to procure \nstandardized extracts of plants as raw material. \nAt present, there are nearly twenty herbal extract manufacturers in the country (out of which 50% are \nvery small manufacturers) with an annual turnover of less than Rs. 4 crores. Major herbal extract \nmanufacturers are given below with their annual turnover in brackets: \n\na. Alchem International, New Delhi (80 crores) \nb. Sami Labs, Bangalore (65 crores) \nc. Chemilloids, Vijayawada (60 crores) \nd. Indfrag, Hosur (22 rores) \ne. Arjuna extracts, Alwaye, Kerala (20 crores) \nf. Sanat Products, Ghaziabad (17 crores) \ng. Amsar, Indore (12 crores) \nh. Dhanwantri, Bangalore (12 crores) \ni. Natural Remediies, Bangalore (10 crores) \nj. Phytotech (5 crores) \n\n4.3 Essential oils from plants \n\nThe essential oil industry was traditionally a cottage industry in India. Since 1947, a number of \nindustrial companies have been established for large scale production of essential oils, oleoresins and \nperfumes. The essential oils from plants being produced in India include ajowain oil, cedarwood oil, \ncelery oil, citronella oil, davana oil, eucalyptus oil, geranium oil, lavender oil, lemongrass oil, \nMentha oil, palmarosa oil, patchouli oil, rose oil, sandalwood oil, turpentine oil and vetiver oil (see \nfigures 2-5). The manufacture of turpentine oil, and resin form pines is a sizable and well established \nindustry in India having 10,000-25,000 tonnes annual production of the oil. α-pinene and δ-3 carene \nare the two vital components produced from the oil. α-Ionone from lemongrass oil for perfumery and \nβ-ionone for Vitamin A synthesis are produced in India. Before, 1960, menthol was not produced in \nIndia but the introduction of Japanese mint, Mentha arvensis and subsequent improvements thereupon \nenabled India to produce over 500 tonnes of menthol and now tops the world market in export of \nnatural menthol. \n\nAnnual world production of limonene is 50,000 tonnes and Brazil is the biggest producer in the world \nmarket. It is a by-product of citrus industry. Though turpentine oil and eucalyptus oil also yield \nlimonene but the best economically cheap raw material is the discarded orange and lemon peel which \nis being used by Brazilian phytochemcial industry. India has not yet tapped this source for limonene \nproduction. During the last five decades, the Indian essential oil industry has made excellent \nprogress. India today is the largest producer of menthol in the world and other aromatic plants such \nas Mentha piperita, M. citrate, Himalayan cedarwood, Jamrosa, basil etc have become commercial \nessential oil yielding crops. Like wise Indian flower extracts from Jasmine, Jasmine Sambac and \ntuberose have become internationally established. The Indian oleoresin and spice oils have also made \nexcellent progress in global market. The world production of essential oil is estimated around 1.2 lakh \ntones per year valued around US$ 1 billion. \n\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4.4 Phytopharmaceuticals \n\nBefore 1947, the production of plant based modern drugs in India was confined to \nquinine from Cinchona in three state owned factories and the very first phytochemi-\ncal industry for quinine was established by the then British Government at Mungpoo \nin Darjeeling. During the past three and half decades' bulk production of plant-based \nmodern drugs has become an important segment of Indian pharmaceutical industry. \nSome of the phytopharmaceuticals which are produced in India at present include \nmorphine, codeine, papaverine, thebaine, emetine, quinine, quinidine, digoxin, \ncaffeine, hyoscine, hyoscyamine, xanthotoxin, psoralen, colchicine, rutin, berberine, \nvinblastine, vincristine, nicotine, strychnine, brucine, ergot, alkaloids, senna \nglycosides, pyrethroids and podophyllotoxin resin. Table 1 gives some important \ntherapeutically used constituents isolated from medicinal plants and used in modern \nmedicine. There are 130 such phytoconstituents used in modern medicine. \n\nPhytopharmaceuticals for which technology has been developed for undertaking \nlarge scale production include L-dopa from Mucuna beans, ajmaline and ajmalicine \nfrom Rauvolfia serpentina and Catharanthus roots, respectively, and 18 β-acetyl \nglycyrrhetic acid from Glycyrrhiza glabra. \n\nIndian Institute of Chemical Technology (I.I.C.T.), Hyderabad has developed \nmethods for etoposide and tenoposide production and CIPLA is now producing it on \ncommercial basis. At present 100 mg of etoposide is sold at Rs. 400/- per vial. \nNational Chemical Laboratory, Pune, developed the method of vincristine (VCR) and \nvinblastine (VLB) production. CIPLA have further improved the process and now \nthey are the third largest manufacturer of VCR and VLB in the world. \n\nMedicinal plants based drug industry is progressing very fast in India, but it is beset with a number of \nproblems. Most alarming problem the industry has started facing and will face in future is the \ndwindling supply of plant material from natural resources. A national policy on medicinal plants with \na view to preserve endangered species and promoting cultivation of plants which are being \nextensively used by industry will help in solving the major problem of the industry. Special attention \nis required on medicinal plants on which significant research leads have been obtained (Table 2) and \nthe overexploited medicinal plants are given in Table 3. \n\nTrade in medicinal plants is largely unorganised and uncertain, both in demand and \nprice structure. There is a need to have Marketing & Development Board for \nMedicinal and Aromatic Plants and Phytopharmaceuticals. Such a Board could \ninteract, with the growers and user industry to bring stability in their production, \ndemand, price, quality and also to help in fostering international trade \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fTable 1 \n\nImportant Active Constituents of Plants Used in Modern Medicine \n\nCatharanthus roseus \nBerberis species \nCamellia sinensis \nCapsicum annum \nErythroxylum coca \nPapaver somn!ferum \nCurcuma longa \nColchicum alllUfnnale \nHolarrhena antidyse,r?ferica \nDigitalis lanata \nRauwolfia vamitoria \n\nActive Constituents Plant Source \nAjmalicine \nBerberine \nCaffeine \nCapsaicin \nCocaine \nCodeine \nCurcumin \nColchicine \nConessine \nDigoxin \nDeserpidine \nEphedrine and \npseudoephedrine \nEmetine \nErgometrine \nErgotamine \nGlycyrrhizin \nHyoscine \nHyoscyamine \nLanatosides \nMorphine \n\nCephaelis ipecacuanha \nClaviceps purpurea \nClaviceps purpurea \nGlyyrrhiza, glabra \nHyoscyamusmuticus \nAtr.opa belladonna \nDigitalis lanata \nPapaver somniferum \n\nEphedra sinica \n\nPapaverine \n\nPapaver somniferum \n\nPharmacological Activity \n\nVasodilator \nAntidiarrlw.:al \nCNS stimulant \nTopical analgesic \nLocal anaesthetic \nAntItussive \nAntiinflammatory \nGout; Antiinflammatory \nAntidysenteric \nCardiotonic \nVasodilator \nBronchodilator, sympatho- \nMimetic, decongestant \nAntiamoebic \nOxytocic \nVasoconstrictor for headache \nAntiinflmmatory \nParasympatholytic \nParasympatholytic \nCardiotonic \nAnalgesic \nSmooth muscle relaxant \n\nPilocarpine \nPodophyllotoxin \nQuinine \nQuinidine \nReserpine \nRescinnamme \nSennosides \nTaxo! \nVasicine \nVincamine \nVincristine and \nVinblastine \nWarfarin \nYohimbine \n\nPilocarpus jaborandi \nPodophyllum peltatum \nCinchona species \nCinchona species \nRauwolfia serpemina \nRauwolfia ca/lescens \nCassia acutifolia \nTaxus baccata \nAdhatoda zeylanica \nVinca minor \n\nParasympathomimetic \nAnticancer \nAntimalarial \nAntiarrhythmic \nHypotensive \nVasodilator \nPurgative \nAnticancer \nBronchodilator \nVasodilator \n\nCatharanthus roseus \n\nAnticancer \n\nMelilotus officinalis \nPausinystalia johimbe \n\nBlood thinner for clots \nTreatment of impotence \n\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fMedicinal Plants on which significant research leads have been obtained \n\nTable 2 \n\nCommphora mukul \nBoswellia serrata \nPicrorrhiza kurroa \nPhyllanthus amarus \nCentella asiatica \nCurcuma longa \nAndrographis paniculata \nWithania somnifera \nColeus forskholi \nAcorus calamus \nSida rhombifolia \nAlbizzia lebeck \nValeriana wallichii \n\nAntihypercholesterlaemic \nAntiarthiritic \nAntihepatotoxic \nantihepatotoxic \nBrain tonic \nAntiinflammatory \nAntihepatotoxic \nAdaptogen \nCardiotonic \nTranquilizer \nAnabolic \nImmunomodulator \nTranquilizer \n\nTab1e 3 \nOverexploited medicinal plants of Himalaya \n\ni.

India’s strength in Medicinal Plant Wealth \n\nIf we dwell for a moment on our glorious past, Rigveda, one of the oldest repositories of \n\nhuman knowledge written between 4500-1500 BC mentions the use of 67 plants for \n\ntherapeutic use and Yajurveda enlists 81 plants whereas Atharveda written during 1200 \n\nBC describes 290 plants of medicinal values, \"Chakra Samhita\" (900 BC) describes 341 \n\nmedicinal plants and the next land mark in Ayurveda \"Sushruta Samhita\" (600 BC) \nmentions 395 medicinal plants3. India unquestionably occupies the top position in the \nuse of herbal drugs, It is one of the, foremost countries exporting plant drugs and their \n\nderivatives, and excels in home-consumption too and this is not all surprising because \n\n11\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fof the following: \n\n- great biodiversity and abundance of flora \n- variety of geographical climatic conditions most exotic medicinal plants \n\n can be grown here \n\n- Indian systems of medicine dwell heavily on medicinal plants \n\n- long tradition of phytochemical research and scientific cultivation of \n\nmedicinal plants \n\n- well developed pharmaceutical industry \n\n - rapidly growing phytochemical and herbal drug industry \n\nIndia is thus in a vantage position to exploit this source both for meeting the domestic demand for drugs \nas also for export. \n\nMedicinal plants continue to be an important resource material for therapeutic agents \nboth in developed and developing countries4-7. The Figure A shows the medicinal plants \nresource and better utilization of traditional systems of medicine. India is among the \ntwelve leading biodiversity centres of the world, harbouring nearly 45,000 plant species \nin 16 agroclimatic and ten vegetative zones. The Indian population is known to have \nused plants in health care regimens for over 5000 years. Nearly 70% of our population \nis dependent on traditional plant based medicines. Over 53 million tribal people of 550 \ntribal communities inhabit the Indian subcontinent and are reported to use around 7500 \nspecies of plants for medicinal purposes. \n\n12\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) PPPHHHYYYTTTOOOPPPHHHAAARRRMMMAAACCCEEEUUUTTTIIICCCAAALLLSSS \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) MMMOOODDDEEERRRNNN DDDRRRUUUGGGSSS \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) CCCHHHEEEMMMIIICCCAAALLLSSS AAANNNDDD \n\nIIINNNTTTEEERRRMMMEEEDDDIIIAAATTTEEESSS FFFOOORRR DDDRRRUUUGGGSSS \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) NNNOOOVVVEEELLL SSSTTTRRRUUUCCCTTTUUURRREEESSS///AAACCCTTTIIIVVVIIITTTIIIEEESSS \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) LLLEEEAAADDDSSS FFFOOORRR NNNEEEWWW DDDRRRUUUGGGSSS \n\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) HHHEEERRRBBBAAALLL DDDRRRUUUGGGSSS \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) GGGAAALLLEEENNNIIICCCAAALLLSSS \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) TTTRRRAAADDDIIITTTIIIOOONNNAAALLL MMMEEEDDDIIICCCIIINNNEEESSS \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) HHHOOOUUUSSSEEE HHHOOOLLLDDD RRREEEMMMEEEDDDIIIEEESSS \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) NNNUUUTTTRRRAAACCCEEEUUUTTTIIICCCAAALLLSSS///HHHEEEAAALLLTTTHHH \n\nFFFOOOOOODDDSSS \n\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) HHHEEERRRBBBAAALLL TTTEEEAAASSS \n\n••• UUUSSS$$$ 666000 bbb wwwooorrrlllddd tttrrraaadddeee;;; \n••• bbbyyy 222000555000---UUUSSS$$$ 555 tttrrr \n• IIInnndddiiiaaa’’’sss ssshhhaaarrreee ooonnnlllyyy 222...555%%% \n\nMEDICINAL PLANTS \nRESOURCE \n\nRESURGENCE \n\nGLOBAL MARKET \n\nCOMPETITION \n\nOPPORTUNITY \n\n(cid:1) RENEWABLE RESOURCE \n(cid:1) ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY \n(cid:1) PRODUCTS SAFER TO USE \n(cid:1) GREATER ACCEPTABILITY \n\nIIINNNDDDIIIAAA AAAMMMOOONNNGGG 111222 LLLEEEAAADDDIIINNNGGG \nBBBIIIOOODDDIIIVVVEEERRRSSSIIITTTYYY CCCEEENNNTTTRRREEESSS \nOOOFFF TTTHHHEEE WWWOOORRRLLLDDD \n\n••• 444555,,,000000000 DDDIIIFFFFFFEEERRREEENNNTTT \n PPPLLLAAANNNTTT SSSPPPEEECCCIIIEEESSS \n••• 111666 AAAGGGRRROOOCCCLLLIIIMMMAAATTTIIICCC \n ZZZOOONNNEEESSS \n••• 111000 VVVEEEGGGEEETTTAAATTTIIIVVVEEE \n ZZZOOONNNEEESSS \n••• 111888000000000 FFFLLLOOOWWWEEERRRIIINNNGGG \n PPPLLLAAANNNTTTSSS \n••• 111888000000 BBBRRRYYYOOOPPPHHHYYYTTTEEESSS \n••• 111666000000 LLLIIICCCHHHEEENNNSSS \n••• 222,,,555000000 AAALLLGGGAAAEEE \n\nFigure 1: An integrated approach to use medicinal plant resource for \ndrugs \n\n13\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFigure \n\nFigure 2 \n\n14\n\n \n \n\fFigure 3 \n\n15\n\n \n \n \n\fFigure 4 \n\n16\n\n \n \n \n\fFigure 5 \n\n17\n\n \n \n \n\f5.1: Domestic demand for 20 major medicinal plants \n\nData for top 20 medicinal plants (quantity) is given in the table 4.

Priorities of Drugs from Plants during 21st century \n\nIt is extremely important and desirable to have “need based” approach for drug \ndevelopment from medicinal plants- this was the major objective of a W.H.O. regional \ngroup which met in 1980. Efforts thus should be directed to a number of diseases for \nwhich suitable or satisfactory drugs are not available in the modern system of medicine \nand where plant based drugs have a possibility of offering drugs for the ailing humanity, \nsome such areas are delineated and where medicinal plants have already provided \npromising leads. \n\n6.1 Antiprotozoal drugs from plants \n\nTropical diseases including malaria where tissue schizontocidal drugs are \nneeded and drugs for multi-drug resistant blood schizonts are required. It has \nbeen estimated that one third of the world's population is exposed to the risk of \nmalarial infections8,9. Most hard hit areas include Africa, India, China and East \nAsia. For Malaria, Quinine from Cinchora bark, the first antimalarial drug used \ngave birth to many synthetic antimalarials like primaquin, pamaquuin, chloroquin \netc none of which nowdays work against resistant strains of malaria parasite. \nArtemisinin, a unique novel molecule from Artemisia annua gave birth to new \nantimalarial drugs like Artether which works against resistant strains of the \nparasite and has been approved by the WHO. Other promising antimalarial \nplants include Alstonia scholaris, Ceasalpinia bonducella, Picrorhiza kurrooa, \nSwertia chirayata, Berberis species, Triclisia patens, Tilicora \ntriandra. \nAmoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica is the major cause of dysentery in \nthe. developing world where an estimated 42 million cases occur annually and \nuntreated disease may progress to hepatic amoebiasis and other complications \nwhich are responsible for 75,000 deaths each year10. Filaria and leishmania are \ntwo other protozoal diseases affecting our population, Many plants like Peganum \nharmala. Celastrus paniculata, Artemisia annua, Berberis aristat.a, Tilicora \ntriandra have been reported11,12 to have activities against various species of \nprotozoa and a variety of such plants have been well illustrated in several recent \nreviews13-16. For amoebicidal drugs plants like Holarrhena antidysenterica, \nBerberis aristata17, Allium sativum18 and Terminalia belerica19 need serious \nattention. Worldwide it has been estimated that 20 million people are infected \nwith Leishmania species and that 400,000new cases occur each year20. The \nplants which have given leads include Plumbago zeylanica21, Diospyros \nMontana22, Ricinus communis and Pytolacca23 species. \n\n21\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f6.2 Antiulcer drugs from plants \n\nImportant plants for the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers that have promising \nprospectus as useful drugs include Prosopis glandulosa, Calendula species. Arto \ncarpus integra, Musa ferrea (pulp) and deglycyrrhizinated Glycyrrhiza glabra and \nmany others which have been reviewed by Lewis & Hanson24. \n\n6.3 Antirheumatic plants \n\nInflammatory diseases including different types of rheumatic diseases are very \ncommon throughout the world. Although rheumatism is one of the oldest known \ndiseases of mankind and affects a large population of the world, no substantial \nprogress has been so far achieved for permanent cure. Our review reveals that \nplant species of ninety six genera belonging to fifty six families have exhibited \nantiinflammatory activity25. \ninclude Aesculus \nhippocastanum, Azadirachta indica, Boswellia serrata, Commiphora mukul, \nCurcuma longa, Ochrocarpus longifolia, Pluchea lanceolata and Vitex negundo26-\n28. \n\n Most significant plants \n\n6.4 Medicinal plants for diabetes \n\nThe world over there are 150 million people suffer from diabetes. In India during \n2001 thirty million people were diabetic. In ten years time, India will be world \ncapital in diabetes as per WHO. Over one hundred plants used in Prameha \n(diabetes) where as several plants have been reported hypoglycemic29a. \n\nAbout 148 plants of 50 families reported to have hypoglycaemic activity have \nbeen reviewed by us29. The most important hypoglycaemic plants which need \nserious clinical trials include Pterocarpus marsupium, Momordica charantia, \nTrigonella \nfoenum-graecum, Salacia prinoides, Gymnema sylvestris and \nCyamompis tetragonolobus. \n\nEach region of the world has developed a material medica of antidiabetic remedies based on the \nlocal flora. It is apparent that diversity as well as similarity can be found in the use of plants \nacross the world. The extent to which various antibeietic plants have been studied differ widely. \nFor some (fenu greek, bitter melon or Gymnema sylvestre) detailed studies in humans, animals \nand in-vitro have resulted in the isolation of active compounds with recognizable modes of \naction. An interesting finding is that plants typically have more than one active compound often \nassociated with more than one mode of action. Additive or synergistic effects between \ncompounds undoubtedly occur, conforming to the view of traditional medicine practitioners that \nthe activity of a medicinal plant cannot be reproduced by the isolation of single active component. \nNevertheless, identification of actives and mode of action are important for drug development and \nfor the validation, standardization and rational use of the herbal drugs29a. \n\n6.5 Antiasthamatic plants \n\n22\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn the lack of any permanent cure in the modern system of medicine for bronchial \nasthma, plants like Albizzia lebeck which have immunomodulatory action need \nserious attention. Other polyherbal ayurvedic formulations like Yastiadivati and \nShereeshadi Kashaya may prove to be efficacious30. Other plants include \nAcalypha indica, Adhatoda zeylanica, Boswellia serrata, Inula racemosa, \nTinospora cordifolia. \n\n6.6 Antiviral plants \n\nA global dengue pandemic that started during world war II has progressively \nspread to involve nearly all tropical countries resulting cumulatively in 5 million \nhospitalized children and causing 70,000 deaths from DHF/dengue shock \nsyndrome (DSS)30a,30b. Currently about 2.5 billion people in over 100 tropical and \nsubtropical countries, representing 50% of world population are at risk from \ndengue W.H.O. estimates 100 million cases of dengue infection worldwide every \nyear30a,30b. Experimental work on a number of plants having antiviral activity has \nbeen done31-34. A lyophilized infusion from flowers of Sambucus nigra, aerial \nparts of Hypericum perforatum and roots of Saponaria officinalis exhibited \nantiviral effect inhibiting reproduction of different strains of influenza virus types A \n& B, both in vitro and invivo and herpes simplex virus type 1 in vitro35. These \nplants need to be carefully examined. \n\n6.7 Iimmunomodulators and adaptogenic plants \n\nThe notion of “resistance” to disease and the idea that such resistance can be \nmodified by life experience and by emotional states, forms one of the basic \ntenets of Ayurveda thus avoiding the Cartesian dichotomization of mind and \nbody36. Concept of Rasayana and Rasaayan plants have been reviewed by the \nauthor37-38. Plant of interest in this area include Withania somnifera, Ocimum \nsanctum, Picrorhiza kurroa, Asparagus racemosus, Pueraria tuberose, Sida \ncordifolia, Desmodium gangeticum, Boerhaavia diffusa and Cissampelos. We \nneed to develop suitable models for testing such vital plants of Ayurveda. \nImmunomodulatory plants have been recently reviewed 38a. \n\n6.8 Hepatoprotective Plants \n\nA global estimate indicates that there are about 18,000 deaths every year \nbecause of the liver cirrhosis mainly caused by hepatitis. Hepatocellular \ncarcinoma is one of the ten most common tumours in the world with over \n2,50,000 new cases each year. Although viruses are the main cause of liver \ndiseases, the liver lesions arising from xenobiotics, excessive drug therapy, \nenvironmental pollution and alcoholic intoxication are not uncommon. Modern \ndrugs have very little to offer for alleviation of hepatic ailments, whereas, most \nimportant representatives of phytoconstituents used for liver diseases, chiefly on \nregional basis, include drugs like silymarin (Si/ybum marianum), catechin \n(Anacardium occidentalis and others) in Europe, glycyrrhizin (Glycyrrhiza glabra) \n\n23\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fin Japan and schizandrins (Schizandra chinensis) in China39. In India, we have \n140 polyherbal commercial formulations reputed to have hepatoprotective action. \nA review published on the subject from our laboratory indicates that 160 \nphytoconstituents from 101 plants belonging to 52 families have antihepatotoxic \nactivity40-41. Our laboratory has worked extensively on Andrographis paniculata42 \nand hepatoprotective activity has been established due to the presence of \nandrographolide. Kutkoside from Picrorhiza kurroa is a potential hepatoprotectant \nreported by CDRI 43-47. Phyllanthus amarus is another most important plant \nselected for clinical trials48. Our future work in this area is bound to give fruitful \ndividends. Antihepatotoxic activity of Boerhavia diffusa and B.repanda has been \nalso reported from our laboratory49. Kolaviron, a mixture of Garcinia kola \n(Guttiferae) biflavonoids at a dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. prevented thioacetamide \ninduced hepatotoxicity50. Withania fruitescens (Solanaceae) leaves exhibited \nprotective and curative action against carbontetrachloride induced liver toxicity51. \nPlant kingdom appears to be a fruitful ground for the discovery of effective \nhepatoprotective drugs, which we currently lack in the modern system of \nmedicine. \n\n6.9 Anti-cancer Drugs from Plants \n\nCancer is an insidious disease affecting mankind in every country. Work on \nperiwinkle plant. Catharanthus roseus (L > ) G. Don was independently taken up \nin two different laboratories for its alleged hypoglycaemic activity as per \nJamaican folklore. Though none of the groups could substantiate hypoglycaemic \nactivity, the Canadian group of Nobel Beer and Cutts succeeded in isolating \nvinblastine while Eli Lilly group headed by Svoboda could isolate vinblastine and \nvincristine along with two other active dimeric alkaloids. These alkaloids are \npresent in exceedingly low concentrations in a complex mixture of 50 alkaloids53. \nVinblastine was introduced (Velban, Eli Lilly) in 1961 and vincristine (Oncovin, Eli \nLilly) in 1963 as anticancer drugs. CIPLA has improved upon the process of \nisolating vinblastine and vincristine from Catharanthus roseus as developed by \nNCL Pune. Today we are the third largest manufacturer of vinblastine and \nvincristine in the world and we are exporting these alkaloids to European \ncountries and the demand is steadily increasing54. \n\nScreening of plant extracts for anticancer activity started in 1961 by \nNational Cancer Institute of the U.S.A., and up to 1981 (20 years) about 1,14,045 \nplants had been screened, of which only 3.4% (representing about 3.400 \ndifferent species) have been observed to be active in one or more bioassay \nsystems. The promising phytoconstitutents which are likely candidates for drug \nuevelopment include indicine N-oxide (a pyrrolizidine alkaloid) from Heliotropium \nilldicum. ellipticine (a monomeric indole alkaloid) from several Ochrosia species, \nhomoharringtonine (a cephalotaxine alkaloid) from Cephalotaxus species, taxol55 \nfrom Taxus species and camptothecine (quinoline alkaloid) from Camptotheca \nacuminata a Chinese tree)56. The author has been successful in discovering a \nnumber of anticancer agents from plants like Ostodes paniculata57, Peddiea \n\n24\n\n \n \n \n \n\ffischeri58, Soulamea soulameoides59, Dirca occidelltalis60 and Passerina \nvulgaris61. The anticancer principles of podophyllum are contained in the resin, \npodophyllum resin or podophyllin. American podophyllum yields 2-8% and Indian \npodophyllum about 6-12% of the resin. It is not only the higher amount of the \nresin present in Indian podophyllum (P. emodi var. hexandrum) but there are no \npeltatins present in contrast to American podophyllum (P.peltatum) which \ncontains (α and β- peltatins. Thus, the Indian podophyllum has higher amount of \npodophyllotoxin. In certain cases Indian podophyllum has yielded 20% resin. The \nhighest amount is in May when the plant produces flowers. Thus the Indian \npodophyllum, when collected at the proper season not only contains 2 ½ times \nor even more of the resin compared to American podophyllum, but this resin has \ndouble the amount of podophyllotoxin which is the active principle used by \npharmaceutical industry for structural modifications to produce anticancer drugs \ntenoposide and etoposide being marketed by Sandoz. Major problem with the \ncultivation of this plant is that the seeds take very long time to germinate. We \nneed to concentrate on cultivation of this plant either by propagation or by \nreducing the period of seed germination. Use of Taxol from Taxus brevifolia or \nTaxus baccata is the latest addition of anticancer drug especially in ovarian \ncancer62. \n\n6.10 Plants for Urinary Stones \n\nThe very first mention of 'Pashanbhed' in Ayurvedic literature is in Charak \nSamhita, and is recommended for painful micturition and for breaking calcui. \nSushrut Samhita mentions the drug under various synonyms - Pashanbhed for \nuric acid calculi and Ashnibhed for biliary calculi. Sushrut Samhita mentions \ndecoction of Pashanbhed, Astimantaka, Satvari, Vrihati, Bhalluka, Varuna \n(Crataevanervula), Kultha (Dolichos bijlorus), kola and katak seeds for patients of \nVataja Ashmari while Kusa, Ashmabhed, Patala, Trikanthaka, Sirisha, Punarnava \n(Boerhavia diffusa) and shilajit are for Pittaja Ashmari. About 4000 plants have \nbeen mentioned to be useful for dissolving stones in the urinary system in a \nreview published seven years ago63. Cystone of Himalaya Drug Co. and Calcury \nof Charak Pharmaceuticals are already in the market. Crataeva nervula bark and \nTribulus terrestris fruits have been put under clinical trials by Indian Council of \nMedical Research, Cucumis trigonus (curcurbitaceae) has been investigated for \nits diuretic activity64. \n\n6.11 Plants as Sedatives/Tranquillizers \n\nIndian valerian (Valeriana waltlchii) contains 2% valepotriates and is thus four \ntimes more potent than European valerian (V. officinalis) which contains 0.5% \nvalepotriates. These are triesters of polyhydroxy cyclopentanop,Yran esterified \nwith isovaleric, acetic and β-acetoxy valeric acid. Compared to known iridoids, \nvaltrats (valepotriates) are neither glycosides nor lectones and are considered \noriginal or primary products present in the drug responsible for activity. Valtrates \n\n25\n\n \n \n \n \n\fare used as tranquillizers and sedatives, and the action is comparable to \nmeprobmate. Additional advantage is that these can be prescribed to alcoholic \npatients. Valerian also contains valernic acid having spasmolytic action. \nValeranone is found in jatamansi (Nardostachys jatamansi) possessing sedative \nproperty. It will be worthwhile to produce valepotriates in India. A peruvian plant \nValeriana thalictroides has been found to contain 14.5% total valepotriate content \nin the roots and thus yields the highest known concentration of valepotriates in \nplants to date65. The high yield of valepotriates in V. thalictroides roots. cannot be \ndirectly used to overcome shortage of valepotraites for therapeutic use, as the \nroots have very small diameter (2 cm) and a length of about 5 cm. V. edu/is ssp. \nprocera (HBK) F.G. Mey, although having a smaller valepotriate content (7%), is \na much better source for valepotriates because of its higher drug yield. However, \nsuch high yielding plants could be used to establish high yielding tissue culture \nfor the in vitro production of valepotriates. Relation between valepotriate content \nand differentiation level in various tissues from valerianaceae has been studied66. \nIsolation and evaluation of valepotriates from Indian valerian are well known67. \n\n6.12 Plants for mental health \n\nFor psychomimetic and/or euphoria \ninducing effects, 217 plant species \nrepresenting 146 genera belonging to 59 families have been used at one time or \nanother at various mental disorders. The substances of plant origin such as \nextracts of Gingko biloba, papaverine from Papaver somniferum fruit latex, \ntheophylline commonly occurring purine base in tea leaves, vincamine indole \nalkaloid from Vinca minor hydrated semisynthetic ergot alkolids have been \nexperimentally evaluated with regard to their cerebrovascular activity in patients. \nMedhya rasayana plants such as Bacopa monniera, centella asiatica, \nconvolvulus pluricaulis, nardostaychs jatamansi and acorus calamus have been \nreported useful for mental disorders67a. \n\n6.13 Plant Laxatives \n\nConstipation is a common problem of Western and European countries because of protein rich \ndiet. In the U.S.A., 1000 patents of vegetable origin are there which involves an annual trade of \n$ 500 million. On an average we export 15,000 tonnes of plantago, 7000 tonnes of senna and \n1000 tonnes of rhubarb annually. Trade in plant laxatives increases by over 10% every year. \nIndia is the sole supplier of Plantago ovata seeds and husk (psyllium) in the international market. \nIndia’s export of Psyllium seeds in 1980-81 were to the extent of 25,743 metric ttonnes valued at \nRs.85.93 million. Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad has published recently a survey \nreport on the psyllium production and marketing in India68. \n\n6. 14 Antihyperlipidemic (lipid lowering) plants \n\nObesity and high lipid content constitute a serious life style problem in the developed countries \nand in the affluent class of the developing countries. In the year 2000 the world statin market size \nwas US$ 16 billion with three products viz. Merck’s Zocor (Simvastatin), Pfizer’s Lipitor \n(Atorvastatin) and Bristol Meyers Squib/Sankyo’s Pravachol (Pravastatin) accounting for 89 \n\n26\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fpercent of sales. The world market of Statins has gone up over $ 25 billion (11 percent annual \ngrowth). Commiphora wightii, Oleogumresin (Guggul) has scientifically proven lipid lowergin \nproperty and ‘Guggulip’ developed by CDRI, Lucknow commercially transformed to CIPLA has \ngreat market value but the raw material is a serious problem as not many trees ae left and new \ntree if cultivated takes over 10 years before it yields guggul. \n\nOther plants mentioned in Ayurveda as ‘Lekhanaya’ have great potential for developing \n\nlipid lowering drugs. Potential ‘Lekhanaya’ plant mentioned in Ayurveda are as follows: \n\nLekhaniya Gana \n\nAs per Chakrapani Sutrasthan \n\nMusta \nKushta \nHaridra \nDaruharidra \nKutki \nAtivisha \nKarnaj \nChitrak \nVacha \n\nCyprus rotundus \nSaussures lappa \n\nCurcuma longa \n\nBerberis aristata \nPicrorhiza kurroa \nAconitum heterophyllum \nPongamia pinnata \nPlumbago zeylanica \nAcorus calamus \n\n6.15 Plants drugs for cardiovascular system \n\nCardiovascular diseases are most prevalent of all diseases. Two thirds of the deaths result from \ncardiovascular diseases and number one killer in the world. Cardiovascular drug market is US$ 50 billion \nper year. Most important cardiotonic, antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive plants are given below68a. \n\nCardiotonics \n\nTerminalia arjuna bark \nNerium oleander \nThevetia nerrifobia Asclepiadaceae \nCarrisa edulis \nAsclepias curassavica \n\nAntiarrhythmics \n\nCinchona sps.

Pitfalls in Plant-drug Research and Implications \n\nMedicinal pant research is beset with a number of problems and the major stumbling \nblocks encountered in plant drug research are listed below: \n\n(a) Medicinal plants being used by traditional practitioners in India not only bear \ndifferent names in different geographical areas and in different languages, but it \nis also not uncommon that different plants are known by the same name which \nadd to the confusion and has resulted in controversial identity of many plants69. \n\n(b) Major causes of inconsistancy in plant drugs include ontogenetic, ecotypic, \ngenotypic and chemo typic besides variations due to harvesting period, method \nof drying and storage conditions. \n\n(c) Ayurvedic, unani practitioners \nformulations, \nwhereas, for obvious reasons, it is easier for the modern scientists to investigate \nsingle plant drug. \n\ninvariably use polyherbal \n\n(d) Appropriate experimental models are not available for validating claims of \nsome very important and useful plant drugs like \"Rasaayana\" enjoying esteemed \nrepute in Ayurveda and termed in modern terminology as vitalizers, rejuvenators, \nadaptogens, immunomodulators etc. \n\n(e) Major national laboratories resorted to more broad based screening of \nplants70 70 by including, apart from plants which are well known and time tested \nby traditional systems of medicine, those which are not mentioned by these \nsystems. Others undertook studies largely on individual initiatives. Inspite of all \nthese efforts, however, the ultimate goal of producing inexpensive, safe and \nefficaceous drugs for most diseases encountered in our country remains to be \nachieved. \n\n(f) The major bottleneck, however, is the lack of scientifically planned clinical \ntrials on traditionally used medicinal plants. Though research work on medicinal \nplants has been carried out in Indian research establishments since long but not \nmuch has been achieved. The beneficial phase of a multidisciplinary integrated \napproach to the evaluation of plants initiated by the Composite Drug Research \nScheme seems to have be almost lost in the pages of history. Recently, \nhowever, Indian Council of Medical Research has adopted new strategy of \ndisease oriented approach of carrying out clinical trials on medicinal plants \nselecting certain 'refractory diseases' i.e. those for which modern medicine has \n\n28\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fnot been able to offer, so far, a satisfactory or a lasting remedy. \n\n(g) The novelty and popular trend on the part of the phytochemists and pharma-\ncologists to continue efforts to find out an \"active principle\" responsible for the \npharmacological action and therapeutic efficacy of a plant, in many instances, \nhas also led to frustrating results. Pharmacologists and phytochemists engaged \nin medicinal plant research may have to change their approach to wholistic plant \nmaterial or with semi pure principles or even crude extracts. Gum guggul \n(Commiphora wightii) is a classic example. \n\n(h) Except for Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, little facilities exist \nelsewhere in India for carrying out pre-clinical evaluation including toxicity tests \non medicinal plants. \n\n(i) Clinical evaluation of plant drugs is an area which is handicapped with lack of \nfacilities and proper orientation of scientists of different disciplines. At present, for \nlack of such facilities even the leads obtained so far are being lost to follow-up. \n\n8. Herbal Drug/Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) \n\nMedicinal plant research has been and continues to be considered as a fruitful \napproach for the search of new drugs71. The highly respected magazine Science calls \nattention in its editorial of February, 1990 to the potential of medicinal plant in the \nsearch of new drugs and expresses concern about the consequences that loss of \nbiodiversity might have in this context. Since most of the chemically unknown flora and \nassociated medicinal lore exist in the developing and underdeveloped countries, \nespecially those which still possess extensive tropical forests, the rapid loss of \nbiodiversity does indeed become an issue for the future of medicinal plant research. \nThe traditional role of developing countries in plant drug production has been as \nsuppliers of raw material. Most of the pharmacological and chemical studies reported in \nseveral journals start by quoting the traditional use of a given plant species promising \nenough to stimulate further research. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the \nindigenous knowledge did play an important role in medicinal plant research and will \ncontinue to do so. Posey72 calls for legislation to secure Intellectual Property Right for \nindigenous people. \n\n9. Herbal Drug Trade \nThe extent of herbal drug usage is hard to quantify for traditional systems of medicine in \nIndia as by tradition many of the practitioner manufacture and formulate their own \nprescription, although there are now about ten well organised large scale herbal drug \nmanufacturers whose individual annual production is of about $ 112 million (June 1988). \nTheir total annual turnover is about $ 350 million73. In U.K. there are about 5,500 herbal \nproducts involving 1,600 herbal ingredients. It is estimated that some 6,000-7,000 tons \nof herbs are extracted annually for the ingredients in U.K. medicine74. Like India, China \nis another country which is noted for its adherence to herbal medicines for a number of \n\n29\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ftherapies like in the treatment of abdominal conditions (appendicitis, perforated ulcers, \npancreatitis), arthritic disease and some neurological disease. There are about 248 \nherbal drugs used for a number of reasons e.g., analgesic sedative, diuretic, anti-\ntussive, antirehumatic and antiasthmatics75. \n\nHerbs and the literature about them are big business in America. In 1985 the sales \nof all forms of herbs exceeded $ 190 million. Unfortunately, most of the literature \nprepared with a single purpose in mind-to sell a product, since to do so most effectively, \nit is necessary to promote or advocate all of the good features of the herb while \nminimizing, or even omitting, any negative aspects, such writings are generally referred \nto as advocacy literature76. \n\nCurrent federal laws do not permit the sale of herbs as drugs, that is, with claims of \nefficacy appearing on their labels. If such claims are made, the efficacy must be proven \nto the satisfaction of the Federal Food & Drug Administration, a process as much as $ \n100 million per drug. Since no one is willing to spend this amount of money on a product \nfor which patent protection is not available, herbs are sold labelled only with the name of \nthe product, primarily in 'health food' stores. Literature purporting to explain the uses of \nherbs is also available in such establishments. Because the laws and regulations \napplied to food naturally do not require any proof of efficacy prior to sale, some \nmanufacturers attempt to market herbal products as nutrients or food supplements, by \ncombining a variety of herbs with standard multivitamin mineral preparation and often \nmake extravagant claim for the products based-on their herbal contents. \n\n10. Herbal Medicines - Medicinal Marvel or Money Spinning Malarkey \n\nAyurveda, with many centuries of experience and cultural support has strengths which \nshould be used only through the experts and vaidyas in Ayurveda or by modern \nphysicians, who have undergone practical training and experience in Ayurveda. But \ngross and rampant commercialization of Ayurvedic herbal remedies, by all and sundry, \nhas to be criticized and even condemned. With the onslaught of m'edia television, radio \nand press several herbal formulations are promoted, often indiscriminately. Consumer \nassociations are very quick and rightly so, when unscientific claims are made by ethical \nmodern drugs. Should they not take up issue with very tall claims by the so-called \nherbal drugs by commercial interests? There is an urgent need to create an ethical code \nfor advertising and promotion of Ayurvedic drugs. \n\n11. Sociopolitical, Economical & Ethical Issues in Medicinal Plants \n\nResearch \n\nDue to enormous difference of wealth generated by supplying crude medicinal \nplant material versus the purified isolated phytoconstituent, the developing countries \nremain the worst sufferers. It therefore, calls for legislation to Secure Intellectual \n\n30\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fProperty Right (IPR) for indigenous people. What are the ethics behind utilizing \ntraditional knowledge without adequate compensation to the societies from which it \noriginates. \n\n12. Herbal Drug Development \n\nOne may propose a development procedure tailor made for herbal drugs. Tradi-\n\ntional medicine usually consists of if mixture of herbal drugs. \n\nIn the first step the therapeutic efficacy of the traditional medicine has to be \nconfirmed. Of course, the composition of the recipe has to be affirmed and \nauthenticated by Pharmacognostic methods which means that we have got to be sure \nwhich plant, identified by botanical nomenclature, and which part of the plant to which \npercentage is used. Only in the country where the recipe has been used traditionally \nclinical trials can be performed. These trials have to be carried out as scientifically as \npossible. Well defined clinical parameters have to be evaluated in a population of \npatients with well defined diagnosis. In India such clinical trials on traditional medicines \nhave been initiated by the Indian Council of Medical Research adopting disease \noriented approach. \n\nIn the positive outcome of such studies we proceed to the second step. We have \nto select one, perhaps in some cases two or three plants as the active ingredients. This \ncan be done by animal pharmacology or clinical pharmacology. At this stage we have to \nattempt standardization employing all possible means like finger printing, TLC, HPLC or \nother related techniques. The clinical trials are performed against a placebo. In each \ncase we have to use as much well defined clinical parameters as possible in order to \nestablish the efficacy of the drug. If the results are positive, we can proceed to the next \nstep where we use purified extract being standardized for the reprocessed extract, we \ncan establish mode of action and also carry out toxicological studies in animals which \nbecome mandatory since we now use much higher concentration of the drug than used \nin the original recipe. With this standardized extract we can perform placebo controlled \nclinical trials, which still should be performed in the country of origin. Nevertheless, we \nmake our first attempt to submit something like Investigational New Drug (IND) in order \nto be allowed to perform phase I or even phase II clinical studies outside the country of \norigin. If the results are positive we can proceed to internationalization of the product. \nThere are some countries in the world where the health authorities have a positive \nattitude to herbal drugs. In these countries facilitated approval may be possible. They \ncan be fore runners for other countries where the developmental requirement would be \nthe same as the synthetic compounds77. \n\n13. Quality control and standardization of Herbal Drugs \n\nThe single and most important factor which stands in the way of wider acceptance of \ntraditional herbal medicines is the non-availability or inadequacy of standards \nfor checking their quality by chemical or bioassay methods. This also prevents \n\n31\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fmodernization or modification of the methods of their preparation or production. \nas there is no way to establish the equivalence of the product made by the \nmodified method with the original product. Thus standardized drugs of well \ndefined consistent quality are needed for reliable clinical trials and therapeutic \nuse. The major reason advanced for the difficulty in developing quality control \nstandards is that these products use whole plant or parts of plants or their total \nextracts, and in some cases even a mixture of a number of plants, it is thus \nchallenging to develop suitable standards because a vegetable drug or a \npreparation thereof is regarded as one active ingredient in its entity, whether or \nnot the constituents with therapeutic activity are known. Standardization, of a \nherbal drug and of a preparation thereof is not just an analytical operation, it \ndoes not end with the identification and assay of an active principle rather it \nembodies total information and controls which are necessary to guarantee \nconstancy of composition. Standardization of plant drugs has been stressed by \nthe World Health Organization78. \n\n14.

This system was reinforced in\nthe Trans-Himalayan region and is popular in the Himalayan\nsocieties such as Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh (Spiti and Lahoul),\nJammu and Kashmir, West Bengal (Darjeeling), Arunachal Pradesh,\nand Sikkim.\nSowa-Rigpa has been recognized and\npromoted by the Government of India as a traditional medical\nsystem. Just like the spread of Buddhism, the Sowa- Rigpa has\nalso established its influence in various parts of the world.\nAlso known as the Amchi System of medicine, it is practiced in\nsome parts of China, the Himalayan regions of India, Mongolia,\nNepal, Russia, and Bhutan. Sowa- Rigpa is perceived to be similar\nto Ayurvedic Philosophy. More than 75 percent of the Sowa-Rigpa\ntests have been derived from the Ashtanga Hridaya; a famous\nexposition of Ayurveda. Many medicines of the Indian-origin such\nas Ashwagandha, Guggulu, Triphala, Ashok, Haridra, etc. are used\nin the Sowa-Rigpa system for treatment purposes.\nIndia had been a learning hotspot for\nBuddhist art and culture and attracted a lot of Tibetan Students.\nAlso, many Indian scholars were invited to prorogate Buddhism and\nother art and sciences of India. This association resulted in the\ntranslation and preservation of Indian Literature on art,\nculture, language, science, and religion in the Tibetan language.\nThese texts were further enhanced in Tibet and are now preserved\nin Tibetan Literatures, both in Canonical and Non-Canonical\nforms. Sowa-Rigpa or the Science of Healing is an example of the\nsame. Gyud-Zi or four tantra was the fundamental textbook of this\nform of medicine that was translated from India and was then\nenriched in the region of Tibet. The principles of Sowa-Rigpa,\nits do’s and don’ts, pulse examination, and dietary guidelines\nare some factors that indicate its proximity within India.\nAbout Section end\nlayout section end\nfooter section start\nSignup (Student & institute) start\nSignup (Student & institute) end\nback to top section start\nback to top section end\nfooter section end\nOther JS Files\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/watermark/common.js\"></script> 04_02_2023\ncustom bg animation start\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"admin/assets/vendor/custom-bg-animation/script.js\"></script>\ncustom bg animation end"

These plants and their products not only serve as valuable source of \nincome for small land holders farmers and entrepreneurs but also earn valuable \nforeign exchange by way of export. \n\nIndia possesses a rich and diverse variety of plant resources to meet the growing \ndemand for plant-based drugs, perfumery and flavour items. Availability of wide \nvariation in soil and climate in our country offers great potential for cultivation of \nthese plants in the country in general and Maharashtra in particular. During the last \ndecades there has been a renewed \ninterest in recognising plants as a \nsource \nand \ncosmetics which may be due to little or \nno side effects associated with their \napplication and user \nfriendly and \nenvironment friendly products. \n\n• Traditional system of medicine caters \n\n• Modern system of medicine caters to \n\nonly about 20% of population \n\nto about 80% of population \n\nperfumes \n\ndrugs, \n\n• Ayurveda uses maximum number of \nnaturally occurring substances as \nsource of medicine \n\nof \n\nis \n\ntherefore necessary \n\nIt \nto collect, \nconserve and evaluate germplasm and \nto develop agro \nfor \nmedicinal and aromatic plants with \npotential for farming. The cultivation \naspects of some medicinal and aromatic \nplants are given in Table 2 & 3. \n\ntechnologies \n\n• Unani, Amchi & Siddha systems \nutilize 700, 600 & 600 medicinal \nplants respectively \n\nPlants have been a major source of therapeutic agents for alleviation or cure of \nhuman diseases since time immemorial. They are extensively utilized throughout \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fthe world in two distinct areas of health management i.e. (i) Modern System of \nMedicine system (ii) Traditional Systems of Medicine. At present there are about \n130 clinically useful prescription drugs of known chemical structure which are used \nin Modern System of Medicine and solely derived from about 100 species of higher \nplants. The traditional system of medicine continue to cater in to the medicinal \nneeds of the about 80% world population. India has a unique position in the world \nwhere a number of Traditional Systems of Medicine are practised such as Ayurveda, \nSiddha, Unani, Homeopathy, Yoga and Naturopathy for the total health care. These \nsystems of medicine are heavily dependent upon the medicinal plants. \n\nA recent study indicates that the herbal drug market continues to grow at the rate of \n15% annually. As per the estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO), the \nglobal market of the medicinal herbs and herbal products is about 62 billion US$ and \nwill hit the market by the year 2005 at the level of 5 trillion US$. India is exporting \nherbal materials and medicines to the tune of Rs. 550 crores. China \nbesides meeting its domestic demands, is earning US$ 5 billion per year from herbal \ntrade. India and China are two great producers of medicinal plants and has \ncapabilities to earn by export of herbs and herbal products of Rs. 5000 crores by the \nyear 2005 with generation of employment to 1 crore people. \n\nMajor Concern \n\nIn India, earlier, the medicines used in indigenous systems of medicines were \ngenerally prepared by \nthe practicing \nphysicians by themselves, but now this \npractice has been largely replaced by the \nestablishment of organised \nindigenous \ndrugs industry. It is estimated that at \npresent there are more than 10,800 licensed \npharmacies in Indian systems of medicine \nand nearly 4,60,000 registered practitioners \nof Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani medicine and Homeopathy. As far as the Ayurvedic \nsystem of medicine is concerned, it does not rule out any substances being used as \npotential source of medicine, presently about 1,000 single drugs and 8000 \ncompound formulations of recognised merit are in vogue. Similarly other systems of \nmedicine prevailing in the country viz., Unani, Amchi and Siddha utilise as many as \n700,600, and 600 medicinal plants, respectively. \n\nLack of Scientific & appropriate \nagrotechnology for cultivation of \nmedicinal plants for different \nclimatic zones of the country \n\nSeveral hundred genera are used in herbal remedies and in traditional or folklore \nmedicines throughout the world. As per one estimate 35-70,000 species have been \nused in some culture for medicinal purposes. They are used in the form of crude \ndrugs which are dried parts of the medicinal plants (root, stem, wood, bark, leaves, \nflowers, fruits seeds and in some cases whole plants) or their extracts. There is \nmuch smaller number of plants from which individual active constituents are isolated \nand used as medicines, either alone or in combination. The species used for \nisolation of active ingredients may be indigenous species growing wild or cultivated, \nor hybrids or other cultivated varieties that have been bred for a particular \ncharacteristic. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn our country there are only few herbal drugs which are cultivated on large scale. \nThe information regarding the area under cultivation of and states where cultivation \nis in progress is given in Table 1. \n\nOne of the major difficulties of medicinal plants cultivation in large scale is the lack of \nscientific and appropriate agrotechnology for different climatic zones of the country. \nAlthough several organisations viz., Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), \nCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Laboratories, various Indian \nUniversities, etc. and Research Councils of indigenous systems of medicine, \nDepartment of Indian System of Medicine (ISM), Govt. of India, have taken up the \nwork of development of appropriate agrotechnologies, and development of high \nyielding varieties of medicinal plants, but much efforts are still needed keeping in \nview the demands of trade and industry. The details of agrotechnologies and \nvarieties developed so far by different organisations of India are provided in Table 4. \n\nExport and import of medicinal plants \n\nproducts – 62 billion US$ \n\n• Global market for herbs & herbal \n\n• Expected to grow upto 5 trillion US$ \n\nby the end of 2005 with a growth rate \nof over 15% annually \n\nThe world trade in the areas of plant based raw materials for the pharmaceuticals, \ndrugs, perfumery items, cosmetics is fast and increasing as evidenced by trade \nstatistics. Although, India exported and \nimported \nlarge number of medicinal \nplants, phytopharmaceuticals and their \nderivatives, its share in the world trade \nhas been rather insignificant. The export \nand import data of selected medicinal \nplants are provided in Table. Psyllium \nhusk and seeds tops the export from \nIndia, followed by Ayurvedic and Unani \nherbs (NES) and Senna leaves and pods \nduring the years 1997-99. One of the \nreason for large export of Psyllium (isabgol) and Senna is due to the problem of \nconstipation faced by the Western people for their food and sedentary work habits. \nIt is interesting to note that a number of items are exported under code number \nspecified as NES that is “Not essentially specified”. The NES group include \nAyurvedi and Unani herbs, other plants, other vegetable, sap extracts and other \ncrude vegetable materials. Thus one does not know exactly what is going out of the \ncountry under the NES regulations. \n\n• India can earn Rs. 5000 crores per \nyear by exports of herbs & herbal \nproducts by 2005 with employment \ngeneration for 1 crore people \n\nIndia is importing certain items which are used as spice as well as medicine such as \ncasia, clove, nutmeg and cardamom. There are certain items such as liquorice, as \nfoetida, chiirayita and ginseng roots which are not at all produced in insufficient \namount for internal cosumption as well as for re-export Table 5 to 10. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fStrategy to improve trade of medicinal plants and their products \n\nFollowing strategies are suggested to improve national as international trade of \nmedicinal plants and their various products : \n\ni) \n\nii) \n\niii) \n\niv) \n\nv) \n\nvi) \n\nvii) \n\nmust \n\nplants \n\nproven \n\nproduce \n\nImproving Trade \n\n(cid:190) Toxicity and efficacy tests \n(cid:190) Cultivation of exotic plants in \n\n(cid:190) Intensification of R and D \n(cid:190) Export of quality material \n(cid:190) Processing technology for quality \n\nR&D on all aspects of medicinal \nplants must be intensified. \nMaterials \nsafety, \nof \neffectivity and quality need only \nbe exported. \nIndian \nbe \ndomesticated and cultivated for \nconsistent quality of the produce. \nharvest \nCrop-wise \nprocessing \nfor \nobtaining high quality produce \nmust be developed. \nToxicity (safety) and efficacy trials \nneed \nconducted on \nayurvedic, unani and sidha medicines and plants drugs. \nCultivation of exotic plants already in extensive usage in USA and Europe \nmust be introduced in India. \nPhytomedicinal monographs for each of the medicinal plant, including \ninformation on physiological effects, efficacy, quality standard and references \netc., are needed to be developed. \n\n(cid:190) Devising cropping schedules \nintegrating medicinal plants \n\n(cid:190) Development of phytomedicinal \n\npost \ntechnology \n\nmonographs \n\ndemand \n\nto be \n\nviii) Cultivation of medicinal plants should be integrated with that of food crops by \n\ndevising suitable cropping schedules. \n\nProcessing \n\nSmall processing units are being erected by private agencies and the crude form of \nproduct is being sold to the pharmaaceutical companies. Consusltancy can be had \nfrom various central institutes. It can be good enterprise if it is done systematically \nby the grower of medicinal plants. The planning is however needed. Normally it is \nobserved that the people start growing the MPs without surveying the requirement \nand then it ends up in loss. Such situation can be avoided after studying the status \nand present requirement at indigenous and global level. Frustrations in this kind of \nbusiness can be prevented with systematic approach. \n\nThe purchaser can be contacted by approaching the concerned patronage. There \ncan be little more efforts in the begining but once the contacts are established, \nfurther it becomes the routine for the buyer and the producer. The rates can be \nnegotiable on the basis of demand and supply. In near future, the raw material \nrequirement is going to be more. Presently, most of the produce is exported abroad \nafter processing. The western countries have more requirement since they are now \naware of side effects of allopathy drugs. The indigenous people are also now \ninterested in herbal medicines and it has now become tedious to meet the \nrequirement of indigenous as well as foreign people. This situation created the need \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ffor systematic cultivation of herbal medicines. Primarily, forests were the major \nsources of raw material but with increased population and demand all over the \nworld, it can not satisfy the raw material needs. \n\nSeveral MPs are listed but few of them which have demand can be highly \nremunerative to the farmer. Several books on medicinal plants are now available \nand some doctors and pharmaceutical companies are in need of growers for \nfurtherance of industry. Benefit can be had of such situation with proper planning. \nThe economics of cultivation should not be ignored. It is the cost effectiveness that \ncan make the enterprenership profitable to the grower. \n\nIn future, the herbal medicines shall have remarkable scope and people will prefer \nherbal drugs for routine ailments instead of planning for allopathic drugs having side \neffects. Every pathy has its own advantage. Promotion of herbal medicines may in \nno case be harmful to allopathic drugs. It has its own merit and it is certainly life \nsaving. The merit of herbal medicine can not be ignored. The farmer should be \nmore tactful in cultivation of MPs and APs after watching the demand. \n\nConclusion : \n\nMedicinal plants and their various products can be viewed as an important \ncommodity items for sustainable economic development of the country. There is \nalso need of organised marketing and trade of medicinal plants and their various \nproducts. To meet the internal and international demands, it has now become \nimperative to produce the quality raw materials in significant quantities. This can \nonly be achieved to promote the domestication and cultivation of medicinal plants \nwhich have internal demand in large quantity and have export and import potential. \n\nAyurveda incorporates ancient plant remedy for different kind of ailments and it is \nnow steered up at global level because of its unique approach without side effects. \nConsiderable countries are interested in herbal medicines and it is supposed to have \nbright future. Few medicinal and aromatic plants can be cultivated under rainfed \nconditions on neglected shallow soils. Every field has small piece of land which \nremains uncultivated due to poor soil properties and water holding capacity. \nPresently, it is either occupied by agroforestry or kept fallow for grasses to the \ncattles. Small herb like Citronella, Aloe, Mentha, Senna, Sagargoti, Reetha, \nSerpagandha, Isabgol, Guggul, Dikamali, Shatawari, Behaada, Birda, Gokarni, \nBhringraj, Belladona and Lemongrass can be grown under natural conditions with \nminimum attention and dry farming can be made remunerative. Two objectives can \nbe achieved. One of utilization of land for additional gain and another for conserving \nthe important plant species which are now neglected and under extinction due to \ndeforestation. Future generation can be benefited by this kind of action. Some \nspecies are at the verge of extinction due to heavy exploitation by pharmaceutical \nindustries. Deforestation resulted in loosing important treasure of unique medicinal \nplants. It needs now to be cultivated for harmless medicines. \n\n... \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fTable 1: Area under cultivation of major medicinal plants in India \n\nSr.No. \n1. \n2. \n\nCommon name \nPsyllium \nOpium poppy \n\nSenna \n\nBotanical name \nPlantago ovata \nPapaver \nsomniferum \nCassia senna \n\nCinchona \n\nCinchona spp. \n\nProducing states \nRajasthan and Gujrat \nMadhya Pradesh, Uttar \nPradesh and Rajasthan \nTamil Nadu, Rajasthan and \nUttar Pradesh \nDarjeeling (West Bengal) and \nTamil Nadu \n\nArea (ha) \n55,000 \n20,000 \n\n20,000 \n\n08,000 \n\nAshwagandha \n\nWithania somnifera Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan \n\n05,000 \n\nand Uttar Pradesh \n\nSafed musali \n\nChlorophytum spp. Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat & \n\n05,000 \n\nPeriwinkle \n\nKhai katari \nSarpaganadha \n\nIpecae \n\nCatharanthus \nroseus \nSolanum spp. \nRauvolfia \nserpentina \nCephaelis \nipecacuanha \n\nUttar Pradesh \nAndhra Pradesh, Karnataka \nand Maharashtra \nMaharashtra \nMadhya Pradesh \n\n04,000 \n\n04,000 \n02,500 \n\nDarjeeling (West Bengal) \n\n00,100 \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n9. \n\n10. \n\nSource : Kumar, S.

These plants and their products not only serve as valuable \nsource of income for small land holders and entrepreneurs but also earn valuable \nforeign exchange by way of export. \n\nScope for Medicinal Plants in Maharashtra \n\nMaharashtra has different agro-ecological zones suitable for growing different \nmedicinal plants, which are in demand. However, systematic efforts will need to \npush this particular sector agro-ecological zone wise. The plant species will have to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fbe identified and their package of practices will be developed. Identification of \nspecies will be important criteria for marketing. Therefore, planting material / seed of \nknown identified varieties from standard source will be important. \n\n1) Planting Material of Known Varieties \n\nSince availability of quality planting material will be essential items of future \ndevelopment programme the farms of the State Agricultural Universities and \nDepartment of Agriculture and nurseries of Department of Horticulture should \nundertake the programme of collection and conservation of different species of \nmedicinal plants prevalent in the region and their multiplication on a large scale. The \nhelp of KVKs and some of the NGOs will also be important in this endeavour. \n\n2) Cropping System \n\nMany of the medicinal trees will need gestation period of 8-10 years for economic \nproduction. The farmers will need the cropping system, which will be suitable for \ngiving him economic return from first year onwards. Therefore, inter cropping with \nspecies of shrubs and trees will be very much essential. \n\n3) Post Harvest Technology \n\nThe post harvest technology for medicinal and aromatic plants is necessary since \nthe plants after harvesting in green stage, if stored unprocessed for want of \npurchaser may get contaminated with fungi which may impair the quality of the final \nproduct. Therefore, post harvest technology for plants their grading and packaging \nand method of storage should be developed. \n\n4) Marketing of Product \n\nIt is experienced that the fanners get convinced about the potential of profit from \ngrowing medicinal plants. However, once they enter into business they get frustrated \nbecause of disorganized market. Therefore, concentrated efforts will be needed to \norganize marketing of the product produced by the farmers. A cluster of villages for \nspecified area under cultivation of some species will have to be identified so that the \nproduce from all the farmers of such cluster will be collected at central place. People \ninterested in purchasing can be invited which will help in marketing the product \nefficiently. \n\n5) Primary Processing \n\nMany items as raw material of aromatic and medicinal plants being very bulky, the \nstorage of such material becomes a problem more so in the case of aromatic plants. \nTherefore, small processing units to serve the need of the cluster of villages will be a \ngood idea. Small cost effective extraction unit should be developed and Government \nwill have to support self interest group of farmers for its establishment. Primary \nprocessing from the bulk material at village level will reduce the problem of storage \nand risk involved in the same. This will help the farmers to get more price for their \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fproduce. \n\n6) Conservation of Extinct Species \n\nMany species which are grown in various forests / regions have medicinal value. \nBecause of the constant harvesting required of these plants many of them have \nbecome rare. Therefore, concerted efforts will be needed for their conservation and \nmultiplication. The help from NGOs and schools for massive campaign to make the \npeople to grow some of the medicinal plants in their court yard of residential \npremises or on the farm bunds will be a good project for conservation of extinct \nspecies. \n\nFor protection of different endangered medicinal plant species encouragement \nshould be given to Government and semi-Government tissue culture laboratories for \nmultiplication of endangered species so that the planting material can be supplied on \nlarge scale. \n\n7) Quality Control \n\nFour SAUs, Ayurved Rasshala and ATMA should be given permission to establish \nquality control laboratories so as to fix the quality parameters for various plant \nspecies and their varieties. \n\nThere are many schemes of the Government of Maharashtra including the \nEmployment Guarantee scheme in which the provisions have been made for \nfinancial support to the farmers who will opt for cultivation of medicinal plant. These \nschemes will need further strengthening. \n\nExecutive Summary \n\nIn future herbal medicines shall have remarkable scope and people will prefer herbal drugs \n\nfor routine ailments in stead of planning for allopathic drugs with side effects. Every pathy \n\nhas its own advantages. Promotion of herbal medicines may in no case be harmful to \n\nallopathic drugs. It has its own merit and it is certainly life saving. The merit of herbal \n\nmedicine can not be ignored. The farmer should be more tactful in cultivation of medicinal \n\nand aromatic plants after watching demand. \n\nLong term plans \n\nMedicinal plants and their various products can be viewed as important commodity items for \n\nsustainable economic development of the country. There is a need of organised marketing \n\nand trade of medicinal plants and their products. To meet national and international \n\ndemands, it is imperative to produce quality raw material in significant quantities. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAurveda incorporates ancient plant remedy for various ailments without any side-effects. It \n\nhas a bright future. Few medicinal and aromatic plants can be cultivated under rainfed \n\nconditions on neglected soils. Putting the neglected patch of land under medicinal plants \n\nlike citronella, awla, mentha, reetha, sarpgandha, isabgol, behada, etc. ensures its utilization \n\nfor additional gain and thereby helps in conserving important plant species going extinct."

    "title": "Influence of Eimeria spp. Infection on Chicken Jejunal Microbiota and the Efficacy of Two Alternative Products Against the Infection | Request PDF",
    "content": "Eimeria spp. are important intestinal pathogens of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). Anticoccidial feed additives, chemicals, and ionophores have traditionally been used to control Eimeria infections in broiler production. Thus, the trend toward antibiotic-free and organic production requires new approaches to coccidiosis prevention. Two not mutually exclusive methods are the use of plant extracts with antiparasitic activity and manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by pre- and probiotics. In the present study, birds were inoculated with a combination of Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima, and Eimeria tenella. We profiled the jejunal microbiome at multiple time points postinfection to investigate the changes in jejunum microbiota and to identify the time point of the maximum difference between infected and noninfected birds. Additionally, we assessed the anticoccidial effects of two anecdotal treatment methods, green tea and apple cider vinegar, as well as amprolium. Green tea and apple cider vinegar had no effect on oocyst shedding, but green tea reduced the mild unspecific lesions in coccidia-infected birds; there was no influence on unspecific lesions in uninfected controls. Jejunal contents were collected on the day of the infection and 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 14 days postinfection (dpi) for investigation of the intestinal microbiota by 16S ribosomal (r)RNA gene sequencing. Comparison of the untreated-uninfected and the untreated-infected groups showed a maximum community dissimilarity of 10 dpi. From 4 days after infection, Clostridiales were significantly enriched at the expense of Lactobacillales in infected compared with uninfected birds. Interestingly, treatment with green tea prevented proliferation of Clostridiales induced by the coccidia and increased the relative abundance of Melainabacteria.\n... These compounds are typically incorporated into poultry feed to prevent or reduce the severity of coccidiosis, a disease caused by a protozoan parasite. Chemical anticoccidials function by targeting specific stages of the Eimeria life cycle to disrupt parasite development\n(Hamilton et al., 2020)\n. However, extended or repeated use may result in the emergence of drug-resistant Eimeria strains, reducing their long-term effectiveness. ...\nInvasion mechanisms of Eimeria coccidian and host immune responses in chicken intestine_A review\nArticle\nFull-text available\nJul 2025\nPOULTRY SCI\nEndashaw Jebessa Bekele\nXian Zou\nHaile Berihulay\nChenglong Luo\nThe poultry industry is one of the fastest-growing subsectors in agriculture, serving as a primary source of protein for the increasing global population. However, chickens carry many fatal diseases that compromise their welfare and negatively affect productivity. Among these, coccidiosis, an intestinal disease caused by Eimeria protozoan parasites, affects multiple animal species and represents a major threat to the poultry industry. Eimeria parasites invade the host cell through a distinctive process, depending on gliding motility, and require a transmembrane link between the host cell and parasite cytoskeleton. Each species invades intestinal epithelial cells in a specific gut region, leading to varying tissue damage and morbidity levels. Understanding the preliminary host-parasite interactions is crucial to revealing Eimeria species' conduct and cellular immune responses mediating the primary and secondary coccidian infection, which can inform the development of effective immunological strategies. The interaction between Eimeria invasion proteins and intestinal epithelial cells provokes a moderate immune response marked by elevated IFN-γ and IL-10 production in chickens. In this review, we highlight recent breakthroughs in understanding the Eimeria parasites that affect the host intestinal tract, emphasizing parasite invasion mechanisms, transmission dynamics, host immune responses, coccidian control mechanisms, and the interaction between host microbiota and coccidia. In conclusion, advancing our understanding of Eimeria invasion mechanisms and coccidia control requires a complex approach that combines cutting-edge molecular insights with innovative therapeutic strategies.\n... Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from 200 µL cecal content using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Between 400 and 450 base pairs (bp) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified as described by\nHamilton et al. (2019)\nusing the Taq PCR Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Primers 515F with linker CS1 and 926R with linker CS2 were used. ...\nResponse of YPM x Ross 708 male broilers to diets containing varying inclusions of phytase, calcium butyrate, and bacitracin methylene disalicylate during the grower and finisher periods–part 2: Intestinal health and physiology\nArticle\nFull-text available\nMar 2025\nJoseph P. Gulizia\nZubair Khalid\nMaria Tereza Terra-Long\nR. Hauck\nThis study evaluated the effects of calcium butyrate (CB) and bacitracin methylene disalicylate 50 (BMD) combined with different phytase concentrations on broiler intestinal health and physiology. Day-old YPM x Ross 708 male broilers (2,880) were distributed in 72 floor pens and assigned to 1 of 9 treatments (8 replicates/treatment). This experiment was a factorial arrangement including 2 phytase concentrations (500 or 1,500 FTU/kg) and 4 microbiota modulating feed additive levels (MMFA; (1) none, (2) only CB (0.5 g/kg of diet), (3) only BMD (55 mg/kg of diet), or (4) both CB and BMD). Additionally, a negative control without phytase and MMFA was included. Intestinal permeability was assessed on d 27. Jejunum wall and cecal content samples were collected on d 28 and 42 to assess jejunum villus height (VH), crypt depth, tight-junction and mucin gene expression, cecal microbiome diversity, and predicted bacterial metabolic pathways. Phytase and MMFA did not influence intestinal permeability (P > 0.05). Combining both CB and BMD with 1,500 FTU/kg of phytase compared to 500 FTU/kg lowered d 28 VH (P ≤ 0.05). Jejunal expression of CL-1, CL-4, CL-5, and ZO-2 on d 28 as well as CL-2 on d 42 changed between MMFA when combined with 1,500 FTU/kg of phytase but not 500 FTU/kg (P ≤ 0.05). Day 42 Pielou's evenness increased when 1,500 FTU/kg of phytase was combined with both CB and BMD compared to no MMFA (P ≤ 0.05). The cecal microbial beta diversity was not influenced by phytase, MMFA, or their interaction (P > 0.05). Overall, broiler intestinal health and physiology were influenced by CB and BMD depending on phytase concentration, demonstrating the complex interactions between these feed additives.\n... Studies have indicated that edible herbs and natural products may be acceptable for consumers and plants performed better anticoccidial activities in some researches (Wunderlich et al., 2014;Daneshmand et al., 2021;Mohamed et al., 2021). It was reported that polyphenols, flavonoids, polysaccharides, and other natural products come from plants could disturb the balance of oxidants and antioxidants on Eimeria oocyst (Molan et al., 2009;\nHamilton et al., 2020)\n. Although only a few plants and their natural products showed similar anticoccidial activity, they may have broad application prospects in future (Daneshmand et al., 2021). ...\nPathogenicity and drug resistance of Eimeria tenella isolates from Yiwu, Zhejiang province, eastern China\nArticle\nFull-text available\nJun 2023\nPOULTRY SCI\nHongchao Sun\nXinyao Su\nYuan Fu\nTuanyuan Shi\nChicken coccidiosis can cause severe enteritis with high mortality, which causes serious economic losses to the global breeding industry each year. The most virulent species is Eimeria tenella (E. tenella), but the infectivity of different E. tenella varies among geographic strains. At present, there are no reports related to the pathogenicity and drug resistance of E. tenella in Yiwu, Zhejiang province, China. A total of 600 fecal samples were collected from 10 farms in Zhejiang province, the overall oocyst prevalence was 54.2% (325/600). The prevalence was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in chickens under 40 d (97.5%) than that in chickens between 60 and 85-days-old (40.5%) and chickens over 90-days-old (24.5%). E. tenella stain was isolated from fecal samples of chickens in Yiwu and the pathogenicity of this isolate was determined, and then we recorded the survival rate, bloody stool score, lesion score, average weight gain. The results showed that all of the chickens infected with 5 × 105 sporulated oocysts of E. tenella died after the seventh day of infection, the bloody stool score and average lesion score of chickens from group 1 (5 × 105), group 2 (5 × 104), group 3 (5 × 103) and group 4 (5 × 102) decreased successively; the average weight gain (g) and relative weight gain (%) increased successively; the weight gain of the low-dose E. tenella infection groups (5 × 103 and 5 × 102) were higher than the other 2 groups (5 × 105 and 5 × 104) (P < 0.05). Finally, The E. tenella isolate was tested for sensitivity to 6 anticoccidial drugs (sulfachloropyrazine sodium, amproline, toltrazuril, clopidol, salinomycin, and nicarbazine) using 4 indexes including anticoccidial index(ACI), percent of optimum anticoccidial activity (POAA), reduction of lesion scores (RLS), and relative oocyst production (ROP). The results showed that this isolate has developed severe resistance to drugs of salinomycin and nicarbazine, moderate resistance to amproline and clopidol, slight resistance to toltrazuril, while the E. tenella isolate performed more sensitive to sulfachloropyrazine sodium.\nNatural Alternatives to Anticoccidial Drugs to Sustain Poultry Production\nChapter\nDec 2023\nKelsilandia Aguiar-Martins\nCaela Burrell\nDamer P Blake\nVirginia Marugan-Hernandez\nFor many farm animal diseases natural compounds are emerging as alternatives to classical drugs and antibiotics. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of coccidiosis in chickens caused by protozoan parasites from the genus Eimeria, outline the measures used to assess anticoccidial drug efficacy and summarise progress towards validation of natural alternatives. It is important to understand current measures of anticoccidial control and their limitations in order to design better, more environment-friendly and antimicrobial-free approaches. Recognising the optimal parameters required to evaluate anticoccidial efficacy in animal trials will encourage better and more consistent experimental design, improving comparison between studies and optimising animal use. Once these concepts have been developed, the chapter provides an extensive review of natural compounds with potential to reduce the occurrence of coccidiosis in chickens, including plant extracts, herbal formulations, essential oils and probiotics. Finally, a compilation of studies using in vitro models as alternatives to animals is summarised. In vitro studies cannot directly evaluate anticoccidial efficacy, but they can become important tools for pre-screening of novel alternative compounds, replacing and reducing animal use.\nA meta-analysis of the effect of Eimeria spp. and/or Clostridium perfringens infection on the microbiota of broiler chickens\nArticle\nMar 2023\nPOULTRY SCI\nAndrea Pietruska\nCristiano Bortoluzzi\nR. Hauck\nCoccidiosis in chickens is caused by Eimeria spp. The infection provides a growth advantage to Clostridium perfringens (CP), frequently leading to necrotic enteritis. One approach to alleviate the negative impacts of the diseases is to improve the bacterial composition in chickens, and many experiments investigating chicken enteric health in recent years include the characterization of the bacterial microbiota. This meta-analysis synthesized the data of studies investigating the intestinal microbiota after infection with coccidia and/or CP to provide a basis for future research. Inclusion criteria were that experiments contained a group infected with one or both pathogens and an uninfected control group, the use of 16SrRNA Illumina sequencing and the availability of raw data. A total of 17 studies could be included. Meta-analyses of 3 different data sets were performed: 1 on data of 9 experiments on chickens infected with coccidia only; the second on data of 4 studies on chickens infected with CP only; the third on raw data of 8 experiments with chickens infected with coccidia and CP. The meta-analysis of relative abundance and alpha diversity of the data sets was performed in R using the SIAMCAT and metafor packages. The number of families of interest identified by the analyses of experiments with infection with coccidia only, CP only and the combined infection were 23, 2, and 29, respectively. There was an overlap of 13 families identified by analyses of experiments with infection with coccidia only and of experiments with the combined infections. Machine learning was not able to find a model to predict changes of the microbiota in either 1 of the 3 analyses. Meta-analyses of functional profiles showed a more uniform reaction to the infections with the relative abundance of many pathways significantly altered. Alpha diversity was not affected by infection with either pathogen or the combination. In conclusion, the heterogeneity of these microbiota studies makes recognizing common trends difficult, although it seems that coccidia infection affects the microbiota more than an infection with CP. Future studies should focus on the bacterial functions that are changed due to these infections using metagenome techniques.\nInfection with Ascaridia galli Does Not Significantly Alter Intestinal Microbiota and Is Cleared After Changes in the Expression of Cytokines\nArticle\nJul 2022\nMaria Tereza Terra-Long\nAndrea Pietruska\nBrigid A Mccrea\nR. Hauck\nBecause of the trend of cage-free egg production, infections with the nematode Ascaridia galli are receiving increased attention. The aim of this study was to establish a timeline for the influence of A. galli on the expression of key cytokines related to a parasitic immune response, and on the composition of the jejunal microbiota. Twenty-eight male layer-type birds were challenged at 24, 25, and 26 days of age. An additional 28 birds were kept as uninfected controls. Starting on Day 31, three birds of each group were euthanized every week until 8 wk postinfection (PI). The number of larvae isolated from the intestinal wall decreased over time, until no larvae were seen at 7 and 8 wk PI. At 5 wk PI, there was a numerical upregulation of all cytokines (TGF-β, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13) in the infected group, but this change was only statistically significant for IL-13. At this time point, larvae were expected to have developed into adults that would have shed eggs in the feces. However, no adult worms were seen and there was no egg shedding. For the microbiota analysis, there were significant differences in the alpha diversity (Faith's phylogenetic diversity) between challenge and control groups, and the beta diversity analysis showed slight differences between samples, suggesting that the age of the birds was the main reason for the separation of groups. These findings suggest that the upregulation of all cytokines evaluated in Week 5 might be the reason for resolution of the infection. Possible explanations are that a high infection dose and the fact that birds were fed with a more nutritionally dense feed might have contributed to the birds' immune system clearing the infection before the worms were able to reach maturity.\nEffects of dietary vinegar on performance, immune response and small intestine histomorphology in 1‐ to 28‐day broiler chickens\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDec 2020\nMohammad Jahantigh\nHeydar Kalantari\nSeyedeh Ayda Davari\nDariush Saadati\nThe purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of apple cider vinegar in diet on the growth performance, immune response, histomorphological changes of the small intestine and some serum biochemical factors in broilers. A total of 85 broiler chicks of Ross 308 were purchased and 64 well‐conditioned chicks were selected and divided into four experimental groups with four replicates and four chicks per replicate. The diets of groups 2, 3 and 4 were mixed with 1, 2 and 3% of vinegar, respectively, and group 1 as the control group was fed by the standard diet. The results showed that body weight gain was higher in the groups fed vinegar than the control group. There were no significant changes in the feed conversion ratio between the treatment and control groups (p = .507). Vinegar intake through the diet did not change significantly the weight of Bursa of Fabricius (p = .369) and spleen (p = .122). Vinegar significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen levels in the treatment groups compared with the control group (p = .0052). There was a significant increase in the level of antibody titre against Newcastle disease virus by haemagglutination inhibition test in the groups receiving vinegar in comparison with control group (p = .0358). Compared with the control group, the villus height (p = .0022) and intestinal crypts depth (p = .0015) significantly increased in the groups receiving apple cider vinegar. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with apple cider vinegar has beneficial effects on performance, immune response and small intestine histomorphology in broilers.\nTwo different Clostridium perfringens strains produce different levels of necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens\nArticle\nFull-text available\nAug 2019\nKosar Gharib-Naseri\nSarbast Kheravii\nChake Keerqin\nShu-Biao Wu\nSubclinical necrotic enteritis (NE) is primarily caused by the gram-positive bacterium, Clostridium perfringens (Cp). The trend towards removal of in-feed antimicrobials and subsequent increased emergence of infection in poultry has resulted in a wide interest in better understanding of the mechanism behind this disease. The virulence of NE, to a large extent, depends on the virulence of Cp strains. Thus, this study was to assess how 2 different strains of Cp affect performance and gut characteristics of broiler chickens. Ross 308 male broilers (n = 468) were assigned to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments with antibiotics (Salinomycin at 72 ppm and zinc bacitracin at 50 ppm −, or +) and challenge (non-challenge, Cp EHE-NE18, or Cp WER-NE36). Oral administration of Eimeria oocysts (day 9) followed by inoculation with 1 mL 108 CFU Cp strains (day 14 and 15) were used to induce NE. Broiler performance was analyzed at day 10, 24, and 35. On day 16, intestinal lesion score and intestinal pH were evaluated and samples of cecal content were analyzed for bacterial counts and short-chain fatty acid concentrations (SCFA). Birds in both challenged groups showed higher feed conversion ratio (FCR), lower weight gain (P < 0.001), increased lesion scores in the jejunum (P < 0.01), and reduced pH in the ileum and cecum (P < 0.01), compared to the non-challenged birds. They also showed decreased numbers of Bacillus spp. (P < 0.001), and Ruminococcus spp. (P < 0.01) in the cecal content. On day 35, the NE36 challenged birds had a lower weight gain (P < 0.001) and higher FCR (P < 0.001) compared to the NE18 challenged birds. Interestingly, cecal Lactobacillus and lactate were increased by the NE challenge (P < 0.001), and to a greater extent in birds challenged with NE36 compared to the NE18 strain (P < 0.001). This study suggests that Cp strains varying in virulence produce different levels of disease in broiler chickens through modulating the gut environment, intestinal microbiota, and SCFA profile to different extents.\nQIIME 2: Reproducible, interactive, scalable, and extensible microbiome data science\nPreprint\nFull-text available\nDec 2018\nEvan Bolyen\nJai Ram Rideout\nMatthew R.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of chickens harbor a diverse and complex microbiota that plays a vital role in digestion and absorption of nutrients, immune system development and pathogen exclusion. However, the integrity, functionality, and health of the chicken gut depends on many factors including the environment, feed, and the GI microbiota. The symbiotic interactions between host and microbe is fundamental to poultry health and production. The diversity of the chicken GI microbiota is largely influenced by the age of the birds, location in the digestive tract and diet. Until recently, research on the poultry GI microbiota relied on conventional microbiological techniques that can only culture a small proportion of the complex community comprising the GI microbiota. 16S rRNA based next generation sequencing is a powerful tool to investigate the biological and ecological roles of the GI microbiota in chicken. Although several challenges remain in understanding the chicken GI microbiome, optimizing the taxonomic composition and biochemical functions of the GI microbiome is an attainable goal in the post-genomic era. This article reviews the current knowledge on the chicken GI function and factors that influence the diversity of gut microbiota. Further, this review compares past and current approaches that are used in chicken GI microbiota research. A better understanding of the chicken gut function and microbiology will provide us new opportunities for the improvement of poultry health and production.\nEvaluation of the Epithelial Barrier Function and Ileal Microbiome in an Established Necrotic Enteritis Challenge Model in Broiler Chickens\nArticle\nFull-text available\nAug 2018\nJuan Latorre\nBishnu Adhikari\nSi Hong Park\nGuillermo Tellez\nNecrotic enteritis (NE) is a recognized multifactorial disease that cost annually to the poultry industry around $2 billion. However, diverse aspects related to its presentation are not completely understood, requiring further studies using known induction experimental models. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to measure the changes occurring in performance, intestinal integrity and ileal microbiome using a previously established NE-challenge model. Chickens were assigned to a negative control group (NC) or a positive control group (PC). In the PC, broilers were orally gavaged with Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) (1 × 10⁷ cfu/chick) at day 1, Eimeria maxima (EM) (2.5 × 10⁴ oocyst/chick) at day 18 and Clostridium perfringens (CP) (1 × 10⁸ cfu/chick/day) at 23–24 days of age. Weekly, body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were evaluated. Morbidity and mortality were determined throughout the study, and NE lesion scores were recorded at day 25. Additionally, blood and liver samples were collected to measure gut permeability as determined by levels of serum fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-d) and bacterial translocation (BT). Ileal contents were processed for 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome analysis. Performance parameters and intestinal permeability measurements were negatively impacted in the PC resulting in elevated serum FITC-d and BT with a −6.4% difference in BWG. The NE lesion score in PC (1.97 vs. 0.00) was significantly higher in comparison to NC, although there was no difference in mortality. The microbiome analysis showed a dramatic shift of ileal microbiomes in PC groups as compared to NC (ANOSIM: R = 0.76, P = 0.001). The shift was characterized by reduced abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria (P < 0.01), and increased abundance of the genera Butyrivibrio, Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Ruminococcus in PC compared to NC (P < 0.05). Expectedly, Clostridium was found higher in PC (2.98 ± 0.71%) as compared to NC (1.84 ± 0.36%), yet the difference was not significant. In conclusion, results of the present study showed the different intestinal epithelial and microbiological alterations occurring in an established NE-challenge model that considers paratyphoid Salmonella infections in young chicks as an important predisposing factor for presentation of NE.\nEffects of Eimeria tenella infection on chicken caecal microbiome diversity, exploring variation associated with severity of pathology\nArticle\nFull-text available\nSep 2017\nPLOS ONE\nSarah Elizabeth Macdonald\nM.J. Nolan\nKimberley Harman\nDamer P Blake\nEimeria species cause the intestinal disease coccidiosis, most notably in poultry. While the direct impact of coccidiosis on animal health and welfare is clear, its influence on the enteric microbiota and by-stander effects on chicken health and production remains largely unknown, with the possible exception of Clostridium perfringens (necrotic enteritis). This study evaluated the composition and structure of the caecal microbiome in the presence or absence of a defined Eimeria tenella challenge infection in Cobb500 broiler chickens using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The severity of clinical coccidiosis in individual chickens was quantified by caecal lesion scoring and microbial changes associated with different lesion scores identified. Following E. tenella infection the diversity of taxa within the caecal microbiome remained largely stable. However, infection induced significant changes in the abundance of some microbial taxa. The greatest changes were detected in birds displaying severe caecal pathology; taxa belonging to the order Enterobacteriaceae were increased, while taxa from Bacillales and Lactobacillales were decreased with the changes correlated with lesion severity. Significantly different profiles were also detected in infected birds which remained asymptomatic (lesion score 0), with taxa belonging to the genera Bacteroides decreased and Lactobacillus increased. Many differential taxa from the order Clostridiales were identified, with some increasing and others decreasing in abundance in Eimeria-infected animals. The results support the view that caecal microbiome dysbiosis associated with Eimeria infection contributes to disease pathology, and could be a target for intervention to mitigate the impact of coccidiosis on poultry productivity and welfare. This work highlights that E. tenella infection has a significant impact on the abundance of some caecal bacteria with notable differences detected between lesion score categories emphasising the importance of accounting for differences in caecal lesions when investigating the relationship between E. tenella and the poultry intestinal microbiome.\nDisruption in the cecal microbiota of chickens challenged with Clostridium perfringens and other factors was alleviated by Bacillus licheniformis supplementation\nArticle\nFull-text available\nAug 2017\nPLOS ONE\nYicen Lin\nShuai Xu\nDong Zeng\nGuangyao Li\nClostridium perfringens can induce necrotic enteritis of chickens, which causes large economic losses every year. Bacillus licheniformis, a probiotic, can inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, thereby improving the health status of chickens. However, from a microbial ecology perspective, the mechanisms by which alterations to the gut microbiota improve health remain unknown. In this study, we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to investigate the cecal microbiota of a negative control group (NC), a C. perfringens and Eimeria challenge group with fishmeal supplementation (PC), a group supplemented with fishmeal and infected with coccidia (FC), and group PC with B. licheniformis supplementation (BL). We found that the health status of C. perfringens-challenged chickens was compromised, and that B. licheniformis improved the growth of the chickens challenged with pathogens. Microbial diversity analysis and taxonomic profiling of groups NC, PC, and FC revealed a disturbed cecal microflora of the birds with C. perfringens. We also characterized the microbiota of the chickens in the BL group using several methods. Principal coordinate analysis demonstrated that, compared with group PC, the bacterial community structure of group BL was more similar to that of group NC. Linear discriminant analysis with effect size revealed less differentially represented bacterial taxa between groups BL and NC than between groups PC and NC. In addition, groups BL and NC appeared to have similar overrepresented microbial taxa (such as Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Megamonas, and Akkermansia) compared with group PC. Finally, a phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states analysis indicated that large differences existed between group PC and groups NC and BL. In conclusion, pre-treatment with B. licheniformis reduced the disturbance of the cecal microbiome induced by challenge with C. perfringens and other factors in broiler chickens.\nInhibitory effect of novel iron chelator, 1-(N-acetyl-6-aminohexyl)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridin-4-one (CM1) and green tea extract on growth of Plasmodium falciparum\nArticle\nFull-text available\nSep 2015\nMALARIA J\nPhitsinee Thipubon\nChairat Uthaipibull\nSumalee Kamchonwongpaisan\nSomdet Srichairatanakool\nBackground\nIron is an essential micronutrient required by all living organisms including malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) for many biochemical reactions, especially growth and multiplication processes. Therefore, malaria parasite needs to take up the iron from outside or/and inside the parasitized red blood cells (PRBC). Iron chelators are widely used for the treatment of thalassaemia-related iron overload and also inhibit parasite growth at levels that are non-toxic to mammalian cells.\nMethods\nInhibitory effect of 1-(N-acetyl-6-aminohexyl)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridin-4-one (CM1) and green tea extract (GTE) on the growth of malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was compared with standard chelators including desferrioxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP) and deferasirox (DFX). A flow cytometric technique was used to enumerate PRBC stained with SYBR Green I fluorescent dye. The labile iron pool (LIP) was assayed using the calcein-acetoxymethyl fluorescent method.\nResults\nThe IC50 values of DFO, GTE, CM1, DFX and DFP against P. falciparum were 14.09, 21.11, 35.14, 44.71 and 58.25 µM, respectively. Importantly, CM1 was more effective in reducing LIP levels in the P. falciparum culture than DFP (p < 0.05).\nConclusions\nCM1 and GTE exhibit anti-malarial activity. They could interfere with uptake of exogenous iron or deplete the intracellular labile iron pool in malaria parasites, leading to inhibition of their growth.\nImproved Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene (V4 and V4-5) and Fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer Marker Gene Primers for Microbial Community Surveys\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDec 2015\nWilliam A Walters\nEmbriette R Hyde\nDonna Berg-Lyons\nRob Knight\nWe continue to uncover a wealth of information connecting microbes in important ways to human and environmental ecology. As our scientific knowledge and technical abilities improve, the tools used for microbiome surveys can be modified to improve the accuracy of our techniques, ensuring that we can continue to identify groundbreaking connections between microbes and the ecosystems they populate, from ice caps to the human body. It is important to confirm that modifications to these tools do not cause new, detrimental biases that would inhibit the field rather than continue to move it forward. We therefore demonstrated that two recently modified primer pairs that target taxonomically discriminatory regions of bacterial and fungal genomic DNA do not introduce new biases when used on a variety of sample types, from soil to human skin. This confirms the utility of these primers for maintaining currently recommended microbiome research techniques as the state of the art.\nDietary acylated starch improves performance and gut health in necrotic enteritis challenged broilers\nArticle\nFull-text available\nAug 2015\nShawkat M'Sadeq\nShu-Biao Wu\nRobert Swick\nMingan Choct\nResistant starch has been reported to act as a protective agent against pathogenic organisms in the gut and to encourage the proliferation of beneficial organisms. This study examined the efficacy of acetylated high amylose maize starch (SA) and butyralated high-amylose maize starch (SB) in reducing the severity of necrotic enteritis (NE) in broilers under experimental challenge. A total of 720 one-day-old male Ross 308 chicks were assigned to 48 floor pens with a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments. Factors were a) challenge: no or yes; and b) feed additive: control, antibiotics (AB), SA, or SB. Birds were challenged with Eimeria and C. perfringens according to a previously reported protocol. On d 24 and 35, challenged birds had lower (P < 0.001) livability (LV), weight gain (WG), and feed intake (FI) compared to unchallenged birds. Challenged birds fed SA and SB had higher FI and WG at d 24 and 35 (P < 0.05) compared to birds fed the control diet, while being significantly lower than those fed AB. Unchallenged birds fed SA or SB had higher FI at d 24 and 35 compared to those fed the control diet (P < 0.05). Birds fed SB had increased (P < 0.001) jejunal villus height/crypt depth (VH:CD) ratios at d 15, increased ileal (P < 0.001) and caecal (P < 0.001) butyrate levels at d 15 and 24, and decreased (P < 0.01) caecal pH at d 15. Birds fed SA had increased (P < 0.001) ileal acetate content at d 24 and decreased (P < 0.01) caecal pH at d 15. These results demonstrated that dietary acylated starch improved WG in birds challenged with necrotic enteritis. Depending on the acid used, starch acylation also offers a degree of specificity in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) delivery to the lower intestinal tract which improves gut health.\n© 2015 Poultry Science Association Inc.\nDifferential Responses of Cecal Microbiota to Fishmeal, Eimeria and Clostridium perfringens in a Necrotic Enteritis Challenge Model in Chickens\nArticle\nFull-text available\nAug 2014\nPLOS ONE\nDragana Stanley\nShu-Biao Wu\nNick Rodgers\nRobert Moore\nClostridium perfringens causes enteric diseases in animals and humans. In poultry, avian-specific C. perfringens strains cause necrotic enteritis, an economically significant poultry disease that costs the global industry over $2 billion annually in losses and control measures. With removal of antibiotic growth promoters in some countries this disease appears to be on the rise. In experimental conditions used to study disease pathogenesis and potential control measures, reproduction of the disease relies on the use of predisposing factors such as Eimeria infection and the use of high protein diets, indicating complex mechanisms involved in the onset of necrotic enteritis. The mechanisms by which the predisposing factors contribute to disease progression are not well understood but it has been suggested that they may cause perturbations in the microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. We inspected changes in cecal microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) induced by Eimeria and fishmeal, in birds challenged or not challenged with C. perfringens. C. perfringens challenge in the absence of predisposing factors did not cause significant changes in either the alpha or beta diversity of the microbiota nor in concentrations of SCFA. Moreover, there was no C. perfringens detected in the cecal microbiota 2 days post-challenge without the presence of predisposing factors. In contrast, both fishmeal and Eimeria caused significant changes in microbiota, seen in both alpha and beta diversity and also enabled C. perfringens to establish itself post challenge. Eimeria had its strongest influence on intestinal microbiota and SCFA when combined with fishmeal. Out of 6 SCFAs measured, including butyric acid, none were significantly influenced by C. perfringens, but their levels were strongly modified following the use of both predisposing factors. There was little overlap in the changes caused following Eimeria and fishmeal treatments, possibly indicating multiple routes for progressing towards clinical symptoms of necrotic enteritis.\nThe use of green tea ( Camellia sinensis ) as a phytogenic substance in poultry diets\nArticle\nFull-text available\nFeb 2014\nONDERSTEPOORT J VET\nSohail Hassan Khan\nThis review examined the use of green tea (Camellia sinensis) in the diets of poultry. Research findings were obtained from various recent studies, where much attention was focused on the role of green tea in the promotion of both animal and human health. The review involved some of the currently available information about green tea, pertaining to its chemical composition, anticoccidial and antimicrobial effect, effect on broiler and layer performance and on blood and egg yolk constituents. To the author's knowledge this is the first review paper on this topic. It will be helpful for poultry nutritionists and the poultry industry, although more detailed studies are still needed to elucidate the effects of green tea in poultry nutrition under various circumstances.\nTrimmomatic: A Flexible Trimmer for Illumina Sequence Data\nArticle\nFull-text available\nApr 2014\nBIOINFORMATICS\nAnthony Bolger\nMarc Lohse\nBjörn Usadel\nAlthough many NGS read pre-processing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools which met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data, and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient pre-processing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data.\nThe value of NGS read pre-processing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output which is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.\nTrimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3.

This study included 2,400 sexed Ross 308 broiler chicks that were equally divided in 2 groups: the infected group, experimentally infected with oocysts of mixed Eimeria spp. at 14 d of age, and the healthy controls. The birds in both groups were further divided equally into 6 groups, of which one was fed a basal diet and served as control without treatment and the other 5 served as experimental treatments. These 5 groups were fed 5 diets containing preparations of 60 mg/kg of anticoccidial salinomycin (SAL), 1 g/kg of multienzyme (ENZ), 1 g/kg of probiotic (PRO), 1 g/kg of prebiotic (PRE), and 40 mg/kg of an herbal essential oil mixture (EOM). Body weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) showed significant improvement in the infected animals, which indicates that dietary supplemental regimens with SAL, ENZ, PRO, and PRE initiated in 1-d-old chicks reduced adverse effects after challenge with coccidiosis; however, chicks that were administered EOM failed to show such improvement. Uninfected chickens showed significant improvement in FCR with supplements SAL, PRE, and EOM, which signifies significant (P < 0.01) infection by supplement interactions for BW gain and FCR. In the infected group, all of the supplements reduced the severity of coccidiosis lesions (P < 0.01) induced by mixed Eimeria spp. through the middle and lower regions of the small intestines, whereas supplementation with SAL or EOM alone was effective (P < 0.01) in reducing oocyst excretion compared with the control treatment. The data indicated that use of these subtherapeutically efficacious supplements (except EOM) in broiler production can lessen the depression in growth due to coccidial challenge.\nPEAR: a fast and accurate illumina Paired-End reAd mergeR\nArticle\nFull-text available\nOct 2013\nBIOINFORMATICS\nJiajie Zhang\nKassian Kobert\nTomáš Flouri\nAlexandros Stamatakis\nThe Illumina paired-end sequencing technology can generate reads from both ends of target DNA fragments, which can subsequently be merged to increase the overall read length. There already exist tools for merging these paired-end reads when the target fragments are equally long. However, when fragment lengths vary and, in particular, when either the fragment size is shorter than a single-end read, or longer than twice the size of a single-end read, most state-of-the-art mergers fail to generate reliable results. Therefore, a robust tool is needed to merge paired-end reads that exhibit varying overlap lengths because of varying target fragment lengths.\nWe present the PEAR software for merging raw Illumina paired-end reads from target fragments of varying length. The program evaluates all possible paired-end read overlaps and does not require the target fragment size as input. It also implements a statistical test for minimizing false-positive results. Tests on simulated and empirical data show that PEAR consistently generates highly accurate merged paired-end reads.

Z. Abbas\nShaukat Hussain Munawar\nZahid Manzoor\nArfan Yousaf\nThe objective of the present study was to evaluate the anticoccidial effect of the different\nconcentrations of the acetic acid in the broiler chickens in comparison with the amprolium\nanticoccidial. A total of 198 chicks were placed 11 per pen with three pens per treatment.\nThe different concentrations (1%, 2% and 3%) of acetic acid and amproilum (at the dose\nrate of 125ppm) were given to the experimental groups in drinking water from 10–19\ndays\nof age. One group was kept as infected non medicated control and one as non infected\nnon medicated control. All the groups were inoculated orally with 75,000 sporulated oocysts\nat the 12\nday of age except non infected non medicated control. Anticoccidial effect was\nevaluated on the basis of performance (weight gain, feed conversion ratio) and pathogenic\n(oocyst score, lesion score and mortality %age) parameters. Among acetic acid medicated\ngroups, the maximum anticoccidial effect was seen in the group medicated with 3% acetic\nacid followed by 2% and 1% acetic acid medicated groups. Amprolium and 3% acetic acid\nwere almost equivalent in suppressing the negative performance and pathogenic effects\nassociated with coccidiosis (Eimeria tenella) challenge. In summary, acetic acid has the\npotential to be used as alternative to chemotherapeutic drugs for Eimeria tenellacontrol.\nConcentration-dependent anticoccidial effect of acetic acid suggests that further studies\nshould be carried out to determine the possible maximum safe levels of acetic acid with\nleast toxic effects to be used as anticoccidial.\nAn improved GreenGenes taxonomy with explicit ranks for ecological and evolutionary analyses of Bacteria and Archaea\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDec 2011\nISME J\nDaniel Mcdonald\nMorgan N. Price\nJulia Goodrich\nHugenholtz Philip\nReference phylogenies are crucial for providing a taxonomic framework for interpretation of marker gene and metagenomic surveys, which continue to reveal novel species at a remarkable rate. Greengenes is a dedicated full-length 16S rRNA gene database that provides users with a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference. We developed a 'taxonomy to tree' approach for transferring group names from an existing taxonomy to a tree topology, and used it to apply the Greengenes, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and cyanoDB (Cyanobacteria only) taxonomies to a de novo tree comprising 408,315 sequences. We also incorporated explicit rank information provided by the NCBI taxonomy to group names (by prefixing rank designations) for better user orientation and classification consistency. The resulting merged taxonomy improved the classification of 75% of the sequences by one or more ranks relative to the original NCBI taxonomy with the most pronounced improvements occurring in under-classified environmental sequences. We also assessed candidate phyla (divisions) currently defined by NCBI and present recommendations for consolidation of 34 redundantly named groups. All intermediate results from the pipeline, which includes tree inference, jackknifing and transfer of a donor taxonomy to a recipient tree (tax2tree) are available for download. The improved Greengenes taxonomy should provide important infrastructure for a wide range of megasequencing projects studying ecosystems on scales ranging from our own bodies (the Human Microbiome Project) to the entire planet (the Earth Microbiome Project). The implementation of the software can be obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tax2tree/.\nNecrotic enteritis in broilers: An updated review on the pathogenesis\nArticle\nFull-text available\nAug 2011\nAVIAN PATHOL\nLeen Timbermont\nFreddy Haesebrouck\nRichard Ducatelle\nFilip Van Immerseel\nClostridium perfringens-induced necrotic enteritis and related subclinical disease have become economically significant problems for the broiler industry. Fortunately, scientific interest in this topic has grown: new C. perfringens virulence factors have been discovered and new insight gained about the pathogenesis of necrotic enteritis. It has been shown that alpha toxin, for a long time thought to be the key virulence factor, is not essential for the development of the disease. Moreover, it is now clearly established that only certain C. perfringens strains are capable of inducing necrotic enteritis under specific conditions that predispose to the disease and they constitute only a minority in the intestinal tract of healthy chickens. A novel pore-forming toxin, NetB, has been identified in these virulent avian C. perfringens strains. Using a gene knockout mutant, it has been shown that NetB is a critical virulence factor in the pathogenesis of necrotic enteritis in broilers. In addition to toxin production, other factors have been described that contribute to the ability of certain C. perfringens strains to cause necrotic enteritis in broilers. It has been suggested that proteolytic enzymes play an important role in the initial stages of necrotic enteritis since the villi are first affected at the level of the basement membrane and the lateral domain of the enterocytes. In field outbreaks of necrotic enteritis, a single clone of C. perfringens is dominant in intestines of all affected birds, as opposed to the mixture of different C. perfringens strains that can be isolated from healthy bird intestines. It has been proposed that bacteriocin production is responsible for the dominance of a single strain in necrotic enteritis cases. Furthermore, it has been shown that virulent strains are more able to adhere to extracellular matrix molecules than non-virulent strains. The current knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease has been summarized in this short review.\nEffect of corn distillers dried grains with solubles and Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance and the intestinal microbiota of young chicks\nArticle\nFull-text available\nMay 2011\nV G Perez\nC M Jacobs\nJ Barnes\nJames E Pettigrew\nChicks were used to determine whether dietary corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) may prevent or ameliorate Eimeria acervulina (EA) infection. The experiment had a completely randomized design with a factorial arrangement of 3 diets (inclusion of 0, 10, or 20% DDGS) × 2 challenge treatments: inoculation with distilled water or with 10(6) sporulated EA oocysts. Each treatment was replicated with 8 pens of 5 chicks each. Experimental diets were fed from 7 to 21 d of age. Inoculation occurred on d 10 of age, considered postinoculation (PI) d 0. Feed intake and BW were measured on PI d 0, 7, and 14. Excreta samples were collected on PI d 0, 5 to 10, 12, and 14 to detect oocysts. On PI d 14, mucosal samples were collected for the analysis of bacterial populations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, using the V3 region of bacterial 16S ribosome. The EA challenge reduced (P < 0.001) ADG by 17%, ADFI by 12%, and G:F by 6% from PI d 0 to 7, and by smaller percentages from PI d 7 to 14. Diet and challenge treatments did not interact in the chick performance, so dietary DDGS did not alleviate EA infection. Oocysts in excreta were detected PI only in EA chicks and no dietary effects were found. Cecal bacterial population was changed (P < 0.05) by effect of dietary DDGS and EA infection. The cecal bacterial diversity among chicks within treatments and homogeneity among chicks within treatments were reduced by EA infection (P = 0.02 to 0.001) and increased by feeding 10% DDGS (diet quadratic, P < 0.001). In summary, feeding up to 20% DDGS to young chicks did not prevent or ameliorate EA infection. Changes in cecal microbiota of chicks fed 10% DDGS can be interpreted as beneficial for intestinal health.\nFast and Accurate Short Read Alignment with Burrows-Wheeler Transform\nArticle\nFull-text available\nJun 2009\nBIOINFORMATICS\nHeng Li\nRichard Durbin\nThe enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.\nWe implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.\nhttp://maq.sourceforge.net.\nStudies on the Relationship between Intestinal Flora and Cecal Coccidiosis in Chicken\nArticle\nFull-text available\nAug 1976\nN Kimura\nF Mimura\nS Nishida\nA Kobayashi\nThe bacteriological and histopathological changes in the ceca of young chickens after being infected with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella were investigated. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria showed remarkable decrease in number on the 5th day after infection, when shizont and gametocyte came to appear, and destruction of mucosa along with severe haemorrhaging was noticed. Other predominanf bacteria like bacteroidaceae, catenabacteria and peptostreptococci showed only moderate and temporal decrease in number during the infection. Clostridium perfringens proliferated after the 5th day post infection following the decline of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Proliferation of Clostridia was so intense that the number was almost million times greater than that of the uninfected chicken at its peak on the 7th day after infection. Enterobacteria also showed a moderate but persistent increase in number. Most bacteria came to the normal population on the 10th day after infection. As for lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Clostridia and enterobacteria, the disturbances were still noticeable on the 17th day after infection.\nAntagonism between proliferated bacteria (Clostridia and enterobacteria) and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) whose intensity is supposed to be related to the cecal mucosa is suggested during cecal coccidiosis in chickens.\nEimeria tenella Infection Perturbs the Chicken Gut Microbiota from the Onset of Oocyst Shedding\nArticle\nJun 2018\nVET PARASITOL\nGuangping Huang\nXiaoli Tang\nFeifei Bi\nXianyong Liu\nCoccidiosis is a serious threat to the poultry industry, resulting in substantial economic losses worldwide. The effective development of alternative treatments for coccidiosis that does not involve chemotherapy drugs and does not result in antibiotic resistance relies on gaining a clearer understanding of the interaction between host intestinal microbiota and enteric coccidia. Here, we established an Eimeria tenella infection model in chickens and subsequently monitored the changes in the overall intestinal microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the gut (i.e. fecal) microbiota of infected chicken differed from that of uninfected naïve animals. Levels of non-pathogenic bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium declined, whereas those of pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium, Lysinibacillus, and Escherichia, increased over time in response to E. tenella infection. Similar dynamic changes of the fecal microbiota were observed in both Arbor Acres broilers and White Leghorn chickens, indicating that the perturbation of the microbiota was directly induced by E. tenella infection. Our findings could be used to further elucidate the serious damage to host health caused by coccidia infection, leading to the development of new effective treatment options for coccidiosis.\nInteractions Between Parasites and the Bacterial Microbiota of Chickens\nArticle\nDec 2017\nR. Hauck\nExcept for the important role coccidia have as predisposing factors of necrotic enteritis, the role parasites play in the dynamics of a healthy microbiota of chickens is not well explored. This review describes the interactions of relevant intestinal parasites of chickens with bacteria. Infection with Eimeria spp. favor the growth of Clostridium perfringens and suppress the growth of many other bacteria by increasing viscosity and passage time of the ingesta, and by causing lesions to the intestinal mucosa that improve the availability of nutrients for C. perfringens. Conversely, there are indications that bacteria influence the course of disease after infections with Eimeria spp. Not much is known about intestinal cryptosporidiosis in chickens, but results in mice show that the intestinal microbiota induces some resistance against infection with Cryptosporidium parvum and that the innate immune response triggered by infections with cryptosporidia might have an effect on other intestinal microbes. Histomonas meleagridis depend on bacteria in vitro, and in vivo it will cause lesions in chickens only in the presence of bacteria. Blastocystis spp. are very common in chickens, but there is no information about interactions with bacteria. In humans, there is evidence of the correlation of the detection of Blastocystis and changes in the intestinal microbiota. There are indications of interactions between Ascaridia galli and various bacteria in chickens and Ascaridia spp. of mammals are known to produce various types of antimicrobial molecules. However, often the underlying mechanisms of these interactions between parasites and bacteria remain unknown and only correlations but not causation can be established.\nTwo necrotic enteritis predisposing factors, dietary fishmeal and Eimeria infection, induce large changes in the caecal microbiota of broiler chickens\nArticle\nMar 2014\nShu-Biao Wu\nDragana Stanley\nNick Rodgers\nRobert Moore\nIt is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and Eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following C. perfringens infection. However, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. We analysed caecal microbiota of 4 groups of broilers (n = 12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) Eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed and Eimeria infected chicks. We found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of C. perfringens infection. We noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable Lactobacillus counts remained stable. The Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, unknown Clostridiales and Lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that had previously been linked to Crohn's disease and reductions in OTUs known to be butyrate producers. Eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; Ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown Clostridium species were increased in abundance. Additionally, Eimeria did not significantly influence changes in pH, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. Both fishmeal feeding and Eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.\nInfluence De La Coccidiose Duodenale à Eimeria Acer Vulina Sur L'Absorption Intestinale De La Lysine Et Sur Les Mouvements Nets De L'Eau Et Des Electrolytes\nArticle\nJan 1976\nN. CarboBaptista\nM. LARBIER\nP Yvoré\nPour étudier l'influence de la coccidiose duodénale à Eimeria acervulina, les poulets âgés de 4 semaines sont inoculés avec 10 oocystes sporulés. Au 6ème jour suivant l'inoculation les 3 segments de l'intestin grêle sont perfusés avec une solution renfermant de la L Lysine C. Ils sont ensuite pesés et séchés.L'infestation par Eimeria acervulina augmente significativement la teneur en eau de l'ensemble de l'intestin grêle. Elle diminue la vitesse d'absorption de la lysine, en particulier dans le jejunum. Dans le même temps, elle modifie les mouvements nets de l'eau dans le sens d'une excrétion nette dans le duodénum et d'une diminution d'absorption dans le jejunum et l'iléon. Enfin, l'excrétion de Na et de K, observée dans les trois segments de l'intestin grêle chez les animaux sains, est nettement augmentée principalement au niveau du duodenum.\nThe Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools\nArticle\nJan 2009\nHeng Li\nBob Handsaker\nAlec Wysoker\nRichard Durbin\nBacterial population changes in the ceca of young chickens infected with Eimeria tenella.\nArticle\nDec 1948\nK R JOHANSSON\nW B SARLES\nCoccidiosis in Chickens: Obligate Relationship between Eimeria tenella and Certain Species of Cecal Microflora in the Pathogenesis of the Disease\nArticle\nJul 1973\nR E Bradley\nC V Radhakrishnan\nThe role of cecal bacterial flora in influencing the development of coccidiosis due to E. tenella was studied by isolating the predominant bacterial species from the ceca of specific pathogen free (SPF) and conventional chickens showing typical cecal coccidiosis. These isolants were used, along with measured doses of E. tenella oocysts, to produce cecal coccidiosis in bacteria free White Leghorn chickens. The indigenous bacterial flora of the ceca of conventionally raised White Leghorn chickens varied with chicken age. Enterococci predominated up to 1 week of age, whereas Lactobacillus sp. predominated in 4 to 5 week old chickens. Bacteroides sp. coli, Lactobacillus sp., and S. fecalis were isolated regularly from conventional chickens at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks of age. C. perfringens was infrequent in conventional chickens but frequent in SPF chickens. Infection of chickens with E. tenella stimulated the growth of C. perfringens in both conventional and SPF birds. Also, large numbers of E. coli and Bacteroides sp., but low numbers of Lactobacillus, were seen in the ceca of infected chickens. In chickens monoassociated with C. perfringens, S. fecalis, E. coli, Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp., Mucor sp., or C. albicans, infection with E. tenella oocysts resulted in mild cecal coccidiosis. Cecal coccidiosis in chickens polyassociated with bacteria was comparable to that seen in conventional or SPF chickens. The data indicate that the indigenous bacteria aid in the development of large numbers of endogenous stages of E. tenella and the production of typical cecal coccidiosis in chickens.\nAnticoccidial effect of green tea-based diets against Eimeria maxima\nArticle\nMar 2007\nVET PARASITOL\nSeung I Jang\nMoo-Hyung Jun\nHyun Lillehoj\nWongi Min\nAnticoccidial effects of green tea (GT)-based diets were evaluated in chickens following oral infection with Eimeria maxima an ubiquitous intestinal parasite of poultry that impairs the growth and feed efficiency of infected birds. Five-week-old chickens were assigned to four groups (GT 0.5%, GT 2.0%, untreated/infected and non-infected control) and each group consisted of 15 chickens. Chickens were fed a standard diet supplemented with ground green tea for 2 weeks prior to infection with E. maxima (10,000 sporulated oocysts per bird). The effects of green tea on E. maxima infection were assessed by two parameters, fecal oocyst shedding and body weight gain. The green tea-fed chickens produced significantly reduced fecal oocysts (P<0.05) when compared to the E. maxima-infected group fed standard diet. The green tea-based diet, however, did not improve body weight loss caused by E. maxima infection. This study is the first to demonstrate anticoccidial effect of green tea on Eimeria parasites.\nAnticoccidial drugs and vaccines\n77-164\nD P Conway\nM E Mckenzie\nConway DP, McKenzie ME.
