Of all the herbs used within Ayurveda, tulsi (\nOcimum sanctum\nLinn) is preeminent, and scientific research is now confirming its beneficial effects. There is mounting evidence that tulsi can address physical, chemical, metabolic and psychological stress through a unique combination of pharmacological actions. Tulsi has been found to protect organs and tissues against chemical stress from industrial pollutants and heavy metals, and physical stress from prolonged physical exertion, ischemia, physical restraint and exposure to cold and excessive noise. Tulsi has also been shown to counter metabolic stress through normalization of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipid levels, and psychological stress through positive effects on memory and cognitive function and through its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties. Tulsi's broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which includes activity against a range of human and animal pathogens, suggests it can be used as a hand sanitizer, mouthwash and water purifier as well as in animal rearing, wound healing, the preservation of food stuffs and herbal raw materials and traveler's health. Cultivation of tulsi plants has both spiritual and practical significance that connects the grower to the creative powers of nature, and organic cultivation offers solutions for food security, rural poverty, hunger, environmental degradation and climate change. The use of tulsi in daily rituals is a testament to Ayurvedic wisdom and provides an example of ancient knowledge offering solutions to modern problems.\nKeywords:\nAdaptogen, Ayurveda, holy basil, lifestyle,\nOcimum sanctum\n, stress, tulsi\nINTRODUCTION\nDiseases of modern life\nDespite the many wonders of science and industry, modern life is fraught with stress. Mobile devices and the web have vastly increased the pace of life so that many people feel that they are now drowning in an ever-expanding ocean of data, while industrial agriculture has burdened us with increasing exposure to unhealthy processed and packaged food and a plethora of pesticides, food packaging materials and other toxic industrial chemicals. Urban dwellers are also faced with increasing wealth inequality, social isolation, excessive noise, air, water and soil pollution and disconnection from nature. Thus, while industrialization has led to longer lifespans and vast increases in human populations, it is now recognized that the greatest causes of death and disease on the planet are preventable lifestyle-related chronic diseases.[\nWe are in the midst of a global pandemic of obesity, diabetes, cancer, dementia, depression and other chronic diseases caused by modern lifestyles and their associated lack of physical activity, high intake of sugar, fat, salt, alcohol and tobacco and exposure to a toxic cocktail of industrial chemicals. The solutions to this current health crisis are therefore more likely to be found in the homes and behaviors of individuals than in medical clinics, hospital or pharmacies.\nAyurveda and lifestyle medicine\nAs a science of life and the world's oldest medical system, Ayurveda has a holistic approach to health and disease that focuses on preserving and promoting good health and preventing disease through healthy lifestyle practices. These practices include consumption of fresh, minimally processed foods, the use of Rasayanas (formulas) that eradicate ageing and disease, sophisticated detoxification practices and regular consumption of adaptogenic herbs that enhance the body's capacity to maintain balance in the midst of a variety of stressors.\nAyurveda's use of medicinal and culinary herbs draws upon India's incredible biodiversity with a variety that is unsurpassed by any medical system; yet, of all the herbs used, none has a status comparable to tulsi or holy basil (\nOcimum sanctum\nTulsi: A potent adaptogen\nTulsi is an aromatic shrub in the basil family Lamiaceae (tribe ocimeae) that is thought to have originated in north central India and now grows native throughout the eastern world tropics.[\n] Within Ayurveda, tulsi is known as “The Incomparable One,” “Mother Medicine of Nature” and “The Queen of Herbs,” and is revered as an “elixir of life” that is without equal for both its medicinal and spiritual properties.[\n] Within India, tulsi has been adopted into spiritual rituals and lifestyle practices that provide a vast array of health benefits that are just beginning to be confirmed by modern science. This emerging science on tulsi, which reinforces ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, suggests that tulsi is a tonic for the body, mind and spirit that offers solutions to many modern day health problems.\nTulsi is perhaps one of the best examples of Ayurveda's holistic lifestyle approach to health. Tulsi tastes hot and bitter and is said to penetrate the deep tissues, dry tissue secretions and normalize kapha and vata. Daily consumption of tulsi is said to prevent disease, promote general health, wellbeing and longevity and assist in dealing with the stresses of daily life. Tulsi is also credited with giving luster to the complexion, sweetness to the voice and fostering beauty, intelligence, stamina and a calm emotional disposition.[\n] In addition to these health-promoting properties, tulsi is recommended as a treatment for a range of conditions including anxiety, cough, asthma, diarrhea, fever, dysentery, arthritis, eye diseases, otalgia, indigestion, hiccups, vomiting, gastric, cardiac and genitourinary disorders, back pain, skin diseases, ringworm, insect, snake and scorpion bites and malaria.[\nConsidered as a potent adaptogen, tulsi has a unique combination of pharmacological actions that promote wellbeing and resilience. While the concept of an “adaptogen,” or herb that helps with the adaptation to stress and the promotion of homeostasis, is not widely used in Western medicine, Western science has revealed that tulsi does indeed possess many pharmacological actions that fulfill this purpose.\nThe medicinal properties of tulsi have been studied in hundreds of scientific studies including\nin vitro\n, animal and human experiments. These studies reveal that tulsi has a unique combination of actions that include: Antimicrobial (including antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antimalarial, anthelmintic), mosquito repellent, anti-diarrheal, anti-oxidant, anti-cataract, anti-inflammatory, chemopreventive, radioprotective, hepato-protective, neuro-protective, cardio-protective, anti-diabetic, anti-hypercholesterolemia, anti-hypertensive, anti-carcinogenic, analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-allergic, immunomodulatory, central nervous system depressant, memory enhancement, anti-asthmatic, anti-tussive, diaphoretic, anti-thyroid, anti-fertility, anti-ulcer, anti-emetic, anti-spasmodic, anti-arthritic, adaptogenic, anti-stress, anti-cataract, anti-leukodermal and anti-coagulant activities.[\n] These pharmacological actions help the body and mind cope with a wide range of chemical, physical, infectious and emotional stresses and restore physiological and psychological function.\nProtection and detoxification\nMany of the physiological benefits of tulsi can be attributed to its ability to assist with the body's internal housekeeping and protection of the body from toxin-induced damage. These functions are often attributed to tulsi's high content of phenolic compounds and anti-oxidant properties, with Krishna tulsi (black/purple variety) having a higher phenolic content and anti-oxidant capacity than white Vana (wild) tulsi.[\nLaboratory studies have shown that tulsi protects against toxic chemical-induced injury by increasing the body's levels of anti-oxidant molecules such as glutathione and enhancing the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, which protect cellular organelles and membranes by mopping up damaging free radicals caused by lack of oxygen[\n] and other toxic agents.[\nTulsi also helps to prevent cancers caused by toxic compounds by reducing DNA damage[\n] and inducing apoptosis in precancerous and cancerous cells, thereby reducing the growth of experimental tumors and enhancing survival.[\n] Furthermore, tulsi not only protects against the damage caused by toxic compounds, but also enables the body to more effectively transform and eliminate them by enhancing the activity of liver detoxification enzymes such as the cytochrome P450 enzymes, which deactivates toxic chemicals and enables them to be safely excreted.[\nWhile these actions are vitally important for protecting against natural toxins produced within the body or by animals or plants, they are perhaps even more important in the modern age to protect against the vast range of pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, radiation and other industrial toxicants created from human activity.\nToxicant stress: Chemicals, heavy metals and radiation\nThe ability of tulsi to protect against the damaging effects of various toxicants has been documented in numerous experimental studies. These studies attest to the ability of tulsi to prevent liver, kidney and brain injury by protecting against the genetic, immune and cellular damage caused by pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals. Thus, tulsi has been shown to protect against the toxic effects of industrial chemicals such as butylparaben,[\n] carbon tetrachloride,[\n] copper sulfate[\n] and ethanol,[\n] and common pesticides such as rogor,[\n] chlorpyrifos,[\n] endosulfan[\n] and lindane.[\n] Tulsi has also been shown to protect against the toxic effects of many pharmaceuticals drugs including acetaminophen,[\n] meloxicam,[\n] paracetamol,[\n] haloperidol[\n] and anti-tubercular drugs.[\nIn addition to protecting against toxic chemicals, tulsi has also been shown to protect against the toxic effects of heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium, chromium and mercury[\n] and the toxic effects of radiation.[\n] Tulsi exerts its radio-protective effects by scavenging free radicals and reducing the oxidative cellular and chromosomal damage induced by radiation,[\n] thereby reducing organ damage and enhancing postradiation survival in experimental animals.[\nPhysical stress\nThe actions that protect against the toxic effects of chemicals and radiation also help to address the toxic effects of many physical stressors. Prolonged physical exertion, physical restraint, exposure to cold and excessive noise disturb homeostasis by inducing physiological and metabolic stress. When the capacity to adapt to these stressors is exceeded, maladaptation occurs resulting in damage to biochemical pathways, organ function and health. Through enhancing various cellular and physiological adaptive functions, adaptogenic herbs such as tulsi are able to protect against this damage.\nStudies using forced-swimming, restraint and cold-exposure stress in laboratory animals have shown that tulsi enhances aerobic metabolism, improves swimming time, reduces oxidative tissue damage and normalizes many physiological and biochemical parameters caused by physical stressors. Similarly, experimental studies have shown that tulsi helps reduce the effects of acute and chronic noise-induced stress in experimental animals, with enhancement of neurotransmitter and oxidative stress levels in discrete brain regions along with improved immune, ECG and corticosteroid responses.[\nMetabolic stress\nMetabolic stress due to poor diet, low physical activity and psychological stress is a prominent feature of modern lifestyles and “metabolic syndrome” is estimated to affect as much as one-third of modern populations. Metabolic syndrome, also known as “prediabetes” or “Syndrome X,” includes the “deadly quartet” of centripetal obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and poor glucose regulation and is associated with chronic inflammation and a greater risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke. While the exact causes of metabolic syndrome are still being debated, there is evidence to suggest that tulsi can assist in dealing with many features of metabolic syndrome and their consequences.\nNumerous test tube and animal experiments as well as human clinical trials have shown that tulsi has anti-diabetic activity. Studies using diabetic laboratory animals have shown that tulsi can reduce blood glucose, correct abnormal lipid profiles[\n] and protect the liver and kidneys from the metabolic damage caused by high glucose levels.[\n] Tulsi has also been shown to improve lipid profiles,[\n] prevent weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance,[\n] and protect the organs and blood vessels from atherosclerosis[\n] in laboratory animals fed high-fat diets. Similarly, in human clinical trials, tulsi has shown to decrease glucose levels, improve blood pressure and lipid profiles[\n] and reduce many diabetic symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes.[\nThe beneficial metabolic effects of tulsi are multiple and include protecting the liver, kidneys[\n] and pancreatic islet cells from free radical damage;[\n] enhancing liver bile acid synthesis[\n] and reducing liver lipid synthesis;[\n] enhancing insulin secretion[\n] and action;[\n] lowering cortisol levels;[\n] and reducing inflammation. The anti-inflammatory action of tulsi, which has been observed in both acute and chronic inflammatory models in animals,[\n] is attributed to tulsi's eugenol and linoleic acid content and the inhibition of both the cyclooxygenase and the lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism.[\n] This enables tulsi to exert anti-inflammatory effects comparable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone,[\n] ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin[\n] and indomethacin.[\nInfection protection\nModern research has revealed that tulsi has anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal activity[\n] that includes activity against many pathogens responsible for human infections. Tulsi has also been shown to boost defenses against infective threats by enhancing immune responses in nonstressed and stressed animals[\n] and healthy humans.[\n] While no human trials have been published, there is experimental evidence that tulsi may help in the treatment of various human bacterial infections including urinary tract infections,[\n] skin and wound infections,[\n] typhoid fever,[\n] cholera,[\n] tuberculosis,[\n] gonorrhea,[\n] acne,[\n] herpes simplex,[\n] leishmaniasis,[\n] various pneumonias[\n] and fungal infections,[\n] as well as mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria and filariasis.[\nTulsi has also been shown to be active against many animal pathogens, and this has led to tulsi being used in animal rearing to reduce infections in cows,[\n] poultry,[\n] goats,[\n] fish[\n] and silkworms.[\n] Tulsi's activity against water-borne and food-borne pathogens further suggests that it can be used in the preservation of food stuffs[\n] and herbal raw materials[\n] as well as for water purification[\n] and as a hand sanitizer.[\nTulsi's broad-spectrum activity, which includes activity against\nStreptococcus mutans\n, the organism responsible for tooth decay, further suggests that it can be used as a herbal mouth wash for treating bad breath, gum disease and mouth ulcers.[\n] This has been confirmed in clinical trials that have demonstrated that rinsing with tulsi is as effective as 0.2% Chlorhexidine and Listerine in reducing the levels of\nStreptococcus mutans\n] and that a herbal mouthwash that includes tulsi is preferred for its taste and convenience.[\nTulsi's unique combination of antibacterial antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities also makes it useful in wound healing.[\n] This is supported by experimental evidence that has shown that tulsi can increase wound-breaking strength and accelerate wound healing in laboratory animals.[\n] Tulsi has also been shown to have anti-ulcer and ulcer-healing activity that has been observed in many different animal models including aspirin-, indomethacin-, alcohol-, histamine-, reserpine-, serotonin-, acetic acid-, meloxicam-, cold restraint-, pyloric ligation- and stress-induced ulceration models.[\n] This anti-ulcer activity is attributed to multiple actions including the reduction of offensive factors such as acid-pepsin secretion and lipid peroxidation and the enhancement of gastric defensive factors such as mucin secretion, cellular mucus and longevity of mucosal cells.[\nMental stress\nIn addition to physical, toxic and infective stress, modern living is associated with heightened levels of psychological stress caused by the many demands and fast pace of modern life. This stress compounds the toxic effects of chemical pollutants and the constant fear of pervasive toxic chemicals can itself lead to even further stress and anxiety that may be just as toxic as the chemicals causing it. While the reality of daily chemical exposure cannot be denied, regular consumption of tulsi not only helps protect and detoxify the body's cells and organs, it can also help reduce toxic stress by relaxing and calming the mind and offering many psychological benefits including anti-depressant activity and positive effects on memory and cognitive function.\nThe psychotherapeutic properties of tulsi have been explored in various animal experiments that reveal that tulsi has anti-anxiety and anti-depressant properties,[\n] with effects comparable to diazepam and antidepressants drugs.[\n] Animal studies further reveal that tulsi enhances memory and cognitive function[\n] and protects against aging-induced memory deficits.[\n] Similarly, in human studies, tulsi has been observed to reduce stress, anxiety and depression,[\n] with a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study reporting that tulsi significantly improves general stress scores, sexual and sleep problems and symptoms such as forgetfulness and exhaustion.[\nWhile modern scientific studies suggest that tulsi is effective in treating a range of stressful conditions, within Ayurveda, tulsi is more commonly recommended as a preventive measure to enhance the ability to adapt to both psychological and physical stress and therefore prevent the development of stress-related diseases. To this end, many Ayurvedic practitioners recommend the regular consumption of tulsi tea as an essential lifestyle practice.\nLiquid yoga\nRegular consumption of tulsi tea may be compared with the regular practice of yoga, which can be considered “adaptogenic” through nurturing and nourishing the body -- mind -- spirit while fostering a sense of relaxation and wellbeing. In contrast, regular consumption of caffeinated beverages such a black and green tea (\nCamellia sinensis L.\n) and coffee (\nCoffea arabica L.\n) may be compared with more aerobic exercise, which confers health benefits through stimulation and activation.\nLike yoga, tulsi has a calming effect that leads to clarity of thought, along with a more relaxed and calm disposition. The cognitive and memory-enhancing properties of tulsi therefore differ from those of caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee and tea, which heightens arousal and may cause physical and mental agitation. Furthermore, tulsi does not produce the same physical dependence as caffeine and can be safely consumed on a regular basis without the fear of withdrawal effects.\nThe drinking of tea and coffee has become an integral part of modern life and has been ritualized in many cultures to guide social interactions, set social agendas and invoke spiritual awareness. For example, sophisticated Asian tea ceremonies involve a whole set of rituals, tools and gestures that serve to transcend normal consciousness, while in the west the ritual of “afternoon tea” or “high tea” emphasizes the surroundings, equipment, manners and social circle. In less-formal situations, many people ritualize their morning cup of coffee and use the “meet-up for coffee” to arrange their social agendas, while the “tea break” is often built into the modern-day work routine. Yet, while tea and coffee have infiltrated their way into modern living, they have not yet attained the status that tulsi has within traditional Indian life.\nDivine tulsi\nIn Hinduism, tulsi is worshipped as a goddess and every part of the tulsi plant is revered and considered sacred, including the leaves, stem, flower, root, seeds and oil. Even the surrounding soil, which has recently been found to harbor beneficial endophytic fungi,[\n] is considered an aspect of the divine. As such, Hindi households are considered incomplete without a tulsi plant, typically in an ornate earthen pot situated in a courtyard where tulsi serves both practical and ceremonial purposes. For example, tulsi's distinct clove-like aroma arising from its high eugenol content serves to link the householder to the divine while also repelling mosquitoes, flies and other harmful insects. Tulsi is further integrated into daily life through evening and morning rituals and other spiritual and purification practices that can involve ingesting its leaves or consuming tulsi tea.\nIn addition to sanctifying the home, tulsi is used ceremonially in Hinduism and some Greek Orthodox Churches to create “holy water.” Tulsi wood or seeds are also used to make tulsi malas, which are strings of beads used to help the mind focus during meditation, chanting and devotional practices and therefore ceremonially connect mind, body and spirit. Tulsi has also been used in cities to combat air pollution and hundreds of thousands of tulsi plants have been planted around the Taj Mahal in Agra to help protect the iconic marble building from environmental pollution damage.[\nNature nurture\nThe cultivation and reverence for the tulsi plant in the home not only serves specific religious purposes it also directly connects the devotee with the creative power of nature. Connection with nature is profoundly healing and life-affirming; yet, the potential health, emotional, social and cognitive benefits of connection with nature are only just being realized in the west where disconnection from nature and “nature deficit” are common. A review of the scientific literature on the health benefits of connection to nature suggest that “access to nature plays a vital role in human health, wellbeing and development that has not been fully recognized,”[\n] and there is now a global movement to reconnect people with nature that has arisen out of concerns over nature deficit, sedentary lifestyles, obesity, mental health issues, excessive use of electronic media, environmental degradation, wildlife conservation, sustainability and climate change.[\nThe placing of a living tulsi plant at the center of the household, therefore, has applicability beyond the realms of Hinduism and may play a useful role in addressing modern day issues through embodying the healing power of the natural world and serving as a constant connection to living nature.\nQuality assurance and identification\nLike any medicinal plant, optimal cultivation, harvesting, preservation and storage methods are required to preserve tulsi's medicinal value. For example, it is suggested that tulsi should be grown employing organic methods in rural areas free from environmental pollution.[\n] This is supported by the finding of toxic elements at almost twice the concentration in tulsi leaves grown in polluted compared with unpolluted areas.[\nIt is also important to ensure the correct herb is used and that manufacturers adopt stringent quality assurance standards and processes. Concerns about product quality in European “tulsi” products have been raised by reports of a high frequency of substitution with surrogate herbs such as\nOcimum basilicum L.\n] This may be addressed using high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and microscopic assays to ensure batch-to-batch quality and the safety and botanical integrity of standardised extracts of standardized extracts.[\nTulsi as a vehicle of consciousness\nPerhaps one of the greatest of tulsi's benefits in the modern world comes from its global distribution based on its cultivation using ethical, fair trade, organic and ecological farming practices. There is a growing realization that in order to tackle issues of food security, rural poverty, hunger, environmental degradation and climate change a shift in agriculture is needed from a “green revolution” to an “ecological intensification revolution. This has been highlighted in a recent United Nations document titled “Wake Up Before It's Too Late,” which calls for the global community to endorse and advocate for local solutions to toxicity, food insecurity and poverty, such as the use of organic and small-scale farming over the use of genetically modified organisms and monocultures.[\n] While ecological farming methods are not specific to tulsi, they have been effectively applied to tulsi cultivation by Organic India Pvt. Ltd. This company, which was established as a “vehicle of consciousness,” works with thousands of organic tulsi farmers in India to produce a business ecology whereby rural Indian farmers gain their dignity and a healthy and sustainable livelihood while serving to nurture the land they live on and produce a range of teas that enable consumers around the world to access the benefits of tulsi.\nCONCLUSION\nModern day scientific research into tulsi demonstrates the many psychological and physiological benefits from consuming tulsi and provides a testament to the wisdom inherent in Hinduism and Ayurveda, which celebrates tulsi as a plant that can be worshipped, ingested, made into tea and used for medicinal and spiritual purposes within daily life. In providing a focus for ethical, sustainable and ecological farming practices that provides a livelihood for thousands of farmers, the cultivation of tulsi goes beyond providing benefits for individuals and households and begins to address broader social, economic and environmental issues.\nFootnotes\nSource of Support:\nConflict of Interest:\nThe author receives remuneration as a consultant and advisor to Organic India Pvt.

It originated in South-East Asia and then used in many countries as a spice and condiment to add flavor to food.[\n] Besides this, the rhizome of ginger has also been used in traditional herbal medicine. The health-promoting perspective of ginger is attributed to its rich phytochemistry.[\n] Jolad\n. grouped fresh ginger into two wide range categories, i.e. volatiles and non-volatiles. Volatiles include sesquiterpene and monoterpenoid hydrocarbons providing the distinct aroma and taste of ginger. On the contrary, non-volatile pungent compounds include gingerols, shogaols, paradols, and zingerone.[\nGinger has staring potential for treating a number of ailments including degenerative disorders (arthritis and rheumatism), digestive health (indigestion, constipation and ulcer), cardiovascular disorders (atherosclerosis and hypertension), vomiting, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. It also has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties for controlling the process of aging. Furthermore, it has antimicrobial potential as well which can help in treating infectious diseases.[\n] Generation of free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) during metabolism beyond the antioxidant capacity of a biological system results in oxidative stress,[\n] which plays an essential role in heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and in the aging process.[\n] The bioactive molecules of ginger like gingerols have shown antioxidant activity in various modules.[\nInflammatory disorders such as gastritis, esophagitis, and hepatitis, which are caused not only by infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites but also by physical and chemical agents like heat, acid, cigarette smoke, and foreign bodies, are recognized as risk factors for human cancer. Ginger consumption before exercise might reduce naturally occurring quadriceps muscle pain during moderate-intensity cycling exercise. This effect may be due to anti-inflammatory effect of ginger and further investigation need to prove it in human.[\nThis study aimed to review the current evidence on ginger effects as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a comprehensive search in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, in order to identify relevant studies. The electronic search was conducted in July 2012, and developed in collaboration with an experienced librarian. Time restriction were applied to year of publication from 2000-2012 and we used literatures only from English language and studied both human and animal models. All titles and abstracts were examined that met our search terms and full publications were reviewed, when necessary. Medline search with the terms: [Ginger] AND [anti-oxidative] and [Ginger] AND [anti-inflammatory], then we had 211 articles. Review articles were only included in this review if they offered new insights or opinions. We could achieve only to 59 articles from these articles and summarized 12 full text studies in the table.\nDISCUSSION\nAnti-oxidative stress effects\nThe rich phytochemistry of ginger includes components that scavenge free radicals produced in biological systems. For the purpose of energy production, some free radicals which generated during the process of oxidation are essential.[\n] Increased production of free radicals results in oxidative stress that can lead to DNA damage.[\n] In such circumstances of imbalance, extra antioxidant supplementation through dietary modules is essential for organism vitality.[\n] The anti-oxidative properties of ginger and its components have been explored in various\nin vitro\nin vivo\ntests. Strengthening the body's defenses by improving the antioxidant status will undoubtedly protect human against many chronic diseases.[\n] 6-Shogaol has exhibited the most potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in ginger, which can be attributed to the presence of alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone moiety.[\n] Animal modeling showed that ginger significantly lowered induced lipid peroxidation and raised the levels of antioxidant enzymes, together with serum glutathione.[\n] Furthermore, feeding ginger to rats at 1% w/w during administration of malathion (20 ppm) for 4 weeks significantly attenuated malathion-induced lipid peroxidation.[\n] Concomitant dietary feeding of ginger (1%w/w) significantly attenuated lindane-induced lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), and the GSH-dependent enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase.[\nIn vitro\n, zingerone scavenged O\nand OH and suppressed lipid peroxidation, so it can possibly value in treatment of Parkinson's disease.[\nEthanol significantly decreased the superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione content in the hepatic tissue. This effect was improved by a treatment with 1% dietary ginger 1 month in rats which suggest that ginger may have protective role against the ethanol induced hepatotoxicity.[\n] Ginger and Arabic Gum showed renoprotective effects in renal failure. These protective effects may be attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating serum C-reactive protein levels and antioxidant effects by reducing lipid peroxidation marker, malondialdehyde levels, and increasing renal superoxide dismutase activity. They could be beneficial adjuvant therapy in patients with acute and chronic renal failure to prevent disease progression and delay the need for renal replacement therapy.[\nIn one study, ethanol extract of\nZ. officinale\nalone and in combination with vitamin E partially ameliorated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. This protection is mediated by renal antioxidant defense system.[\nIn the other study, the protective effect of the ginger extract was examined on CCl (4) and acetaminophen-induced liver damage and indicated that\nZ. officinale\ncould be useful in preventing acute liver injury.[\nThe overall evaluation of one study concludes that both spices ginger and cumin have good antioxidant potential, particularly fresh ginger. Methanol extracts of all the samples were found to have better antioxidant action than the\n-hexane extracts. There was also a good correlation between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of the non-volatile extracts.[\nRat studies showed that ginger has an equal antioxidant effect to that of ascorbic acid.[\nGhasemzadeh\n. validated the medicinal potential of the leaves and young rhizome of\nZ. officinale\n(Halia Bara) and the positive relationship between total phenolics content and antioxidant activities in\nZ. officinale\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn ancient cultures, medical practitioners focused on herbs for promoting the immune systems of body. In many countries ginger and its products raise the immune system.[\nGingerol, shogaol, and other structurally-related substances in ginger inhibit prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis through suppression of 5-lipoxygenase or prostaglandin synthetase. Additionally, they can also inhibit synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-8.[\n] In another investigation, Pan\n. showed that in macrophages,[\n] shogaol can down-regulate inflammatory iNOS and COX-2 gene expression.[\n] Jung\n. indicated that rhizome hexane fraction extract of\nZ. officinale\ninhibited the excessive production of NO, PGE (2), TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta.[\n] Because of potent compounds in ginger rhizome for inhibiting allergic reactions, it may be useful for the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases.[\n. showed that ginger extract can reduce the elevated expression of NFκB and TNF-α in rats with liver cancer.[\n] The activation of NF-κB is linked to a variety of inflammatory diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, diabetes, allergy, asthma, arthritis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, psoriasis, septic shock, and AIDS.[\n. showed that gingerols can inhibit LPS-induced COX-2 expression while shogaol containing extracts has no effect on COX-2 expression. These data demonstrate that important compounds in ginger are capable of inhibiting PGE (2) production.[\nStudies evaluating the effectiveness of ginger in patients with osteoarthritis have controversial results. One study showed ginger extract to have a statistically significant effect on reducing symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee.[\n] In another study, the effect of ginger in osteoarthritis was significant only in the first period of treatment.[\n] In gout as a rheumatic disease of joints, [6]-shogaol has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and can be used as a curative agent.[\n. showed that treatment of patients with has hypo-algesic effects. They used 2 g of ginger supplementation for 11 days of on 36 participants to cure muscle pain. They proved that daily consumption of raw and heat-treated ginger resulted in moderate-to-large reductions in muscle pain.[\nHowever, cohort studies and controlled trails in sort of\nin vivo\nin vitro\nneed to be to warrant the pharmacological applications of ginger.\nAnti-cancer effects\nThe mechanism of ginger for acting as chemopreventive spice remains a matter of conflict among researchers. Ingredients like [6]-gingerol,[6]-shogaol, [6]-paradol, and zerumbone in ginger exhibits anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic activities.[\n] Ginger and its bioactive molecules are effective in controlling the extent of colorectal, gastric, ovarian, liver, skin, breast, and prostate cancers.[\nColorectal cancer is more prevalent in vegetarians and ginger could be effective in reducing the extent of this disease. Manju and Nalini studied the efficacy of ginger against 1, 2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer. They observed that ginger supplementation can activate various enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione reductase and suppress colon carcinogenesis.[\n. administered Zerumbone orally in mouse models and observed inhibition in multiplicity of colonic adenocarcinomas through suppression of colonic inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism of that includes inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and suppression of NF-κB and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression.[\nIn gastric cancer, the tumor necrosis factor-related inducing apoptosis ligand (TRIALS) plays a major role by promoting apoptosis. Cascades of caspase proteins activate by ginger and its functional components.[\n] Ishiguro\n. explained a model for [6]-gingerol and[6]-shogaol action against gastric cancer cells. They observed that [6]-gingerol inhibits TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation by impairing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, suppresses cIAP1 expression, and increases TRAIL-induced caspase-3/7 activation.[\nYagihashi\n. reported that [6]-gingerol can inhibit both proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction are the main causes of [6]-gingerol in these cancerous cells.[\n] Habib\n. suggested that ginger extract can reduce the elevated expression of NF-κB and TNF-alpha in rats with liver cancer.[\nInhibition of angiogenesis in the mouse skin is the mechanism of ginger for treating of skin cancer.[\n[6]-Gingerol exhibited considerable cytotoxicity by growth inhibition of human epidermoid carcinoma cells mediated via reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced apoptosis.[\nThe effectiveness of ginger and its biomolecules has been demonstrated for controlling of ovarian cancer. Ginger inhibited NF-κB activation and diminished the secretion of VEGF and IL-8 helping to treat ovarian cancer.[\n. showed that zerumbone induced apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cells through p53 signal pathway, formation of apoptotic bodies, condensed nuclei, and the increased activity of caspase-3. So, zerumbone is a new therapeutic candidate for controlling of pancreatic cancer.[\n. indicated that ginger can cure breast cancer via inhibiting cell adhesion invasion motility.[\n[6]-gingerol can affect prostate cancer models by modulation of proteins involved in apoptosis pathway.[\nAnti-diabetic effects\nSome research studies have proved the effectiveness of ginger against diabetes and its complications. Weidner and Sigwart conducted an experimental study and indicated that ginger extract with a high content of gingerols and shogaols did not induce significant changes in blood glucose, blood coagulation, blood pressure, and heart rate in rat models.[\n] However, ginger significantly lowered blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides, and raised HDL in hyperglycemic rats, in models that are diabetic, deficient in the apolipoprotein E gene or those that have been fed a high lipid diet.[\n] Bhandari\n. showed that ethanolic extract of\nZingiber officinale\nfed orally for 20 days produced a significant antihyperglycaemic effect (\n< 0.01) in diabetic rats.[\n] Additionally, Nammi\n. indicated that the ethanolic extract of ginger reduced body weights and levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phospholipids in high-fat diets.[\n] Heimes\n. supported from this hypoglycemic potential, too.[\n] Insulinoptropic properties of ginger and glucose-lowering potential were explained by Islam and Choi.[\nWe summarized 12 studies from these articles in\nTable 1\nTable 1.\nTwelve selected studies with full text article\nOpen in a new tab\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe health-promoting perspectives of ginger are well known. It can treat a wide range of diseases via immunonutrition and anti-inflammatory responses. As a result of anti-inflammatory effect of ginger, it can reduce muscle pain after intense physical activity. Likewise, the anticancer potential of ginger is well documented and its functional ingredients like gingerols, shogaol, and paradols are the valuable ingredients which can prevent various cancers, angiogenesis and metastasis, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of cell-cycle progression. Besides these, it improves cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and gastrointestinal health.\nThis review concludes to favor ginger but some ambiguities necessitate further research before claiming its efficacy.\nFootnotes\nSource of Support:\nConflict of Interest:\nNone declared\nREFERENCES\nPark EJ, Pizzuto JM.

A new study shows that ambiguous mistakes in bimanual movements are corrected by the non-dominant hand, and responsibility for the error is assumed to fall to the effector with a recent history of poor performance.\nMain Text\nIn recent years, there have been a number of important theoretical developments which have revised the way we think about the control of human movement. Imagine a task such as playing a game of tennis. The challenges are daunting — the modern game is extraordinarily fast, and each action must be made at the limits of human reaction times, so that tennis strokes are planned and executed well before the ball arrives at the racquet. For a powerful player like Andy Roddick, the ball is served so fast — 155 mph — that it reaches the opponent's baseline in about 350 milliseconds. Estimating the ball's trajectory accurately enough to reach and return it requires the combination of incomplete sensory information from the visual system with prior knowledge of the ball's likely distribution of positions — Roddick tends to get the ball inside the tramlines more often than not. Kording and Wolpert\nshowed in a laboratory version of this task that we use a Bayesian approach in which we optimally integrate sensory information about the current event with prior knowledge of the distribution of past events.\nConsider next the challenge for Roddick's opponent in returning the serve. He plans the swing of the racquet to reach the approaching ball, but again must integrate his motor plan with sensory feedback about its execution. The evolving act must be refined and modified as the latest sensory information is processed, specifying both where the ball is bouncing and how his race along the baseline is progressing. Todorov and Jordan\ndeveloped the theory of optimal feedback control, in which sensory feedback and prior knowledge are combined into a ‘state estimate’ of the current situation that is integrated with the goal of the action to dynamically specify the optimal motor responses required. The key concept is of ‘minimum intervention’. Control gains are adjusted according to the task, allowing irrelevant parameters to be uncontrolled (low gain) while task-critical parameters have high gain\n. This was a significant advance over previous theories which could define an optimal plan in advance of an action\n, but could not easily modify the plan to deal with intrinsic variation in its execution or with changes in the external environment.\nNow, take things a step further. Imagine when someone like me attempts to play tennis. I might be ambitious and try a two-handed backhand stroke. But it goes wrong (it always does!) and the racquet misses the ball (\nFigure 1\nA). Is it because my left arm was weak, or my right arm a bit slow? How should I untangle the ambiguity about the responsible effector muscles so that I can first correct the mistake, and second learn from the mistake to improve my performance? Because I am right-handed, my left arm is likely to be less accurate, so should I try to use my right arm to correct for the error, as it is better able to do so, or should I make my left arm correct the mistakes it was responsible for, and learn from them for next time?\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\n(A) Bimanual actions have redundancy because either or both arms can contribute to the action. So an error — missing the ball — could have been caused by a mistake from either arm. It might also be due to external events, such as a gust of wind. The ellipses indicate unequal certainty about the state of each arm. For right handers, the right arm is more reliable, less uncertain (red ellipse). So the mistake is more likely caused by the more uncertain left arm (blue). (B) Experimental design. The forward movement of a single cursor (centre) towards a target (yellow) is controlled by both unseen arms, but is rotated clockwise about its origin. The two hands share the correction (C\n). On the subsequent trial, the two hands also adjust their initial direction to better control the rotated cursor. (Panel B adapted from\nAs they report in this issue of\nCurrent Biology\n, White and Diedrichsen\nhave developed a clever experimental design to address these questions. Participants hold two lightweight mechanical arms and see the average of the two handle positions as a cursor on a screen which they must move towards a visual target (\nFigure 1\nB). Because the cursor reflects the average of both hands, the task is inherently redundant — one hand or the other could do all the work, or both hands can share the effort\n. Likewise, an error — introduced experimentally by rotation of the path of the cursor around its start position — is ambiguous and could have been caused by either the left hand or the right hand misreaching. What the authors\nfirst found is that for a group of right handers, the left hand corrected for the rotated cursor position more than the right hand. They confirmed this result by testing left handers, who are typically less lateralized than right handers, and found a weak effect in the opposite direction. Combing both groups, there was a strong relationship between handedness and the asymmetry of the corrections. The more dominant was one hand, the less likely it was to correct the error.\nWhite and Diedrichsen\nasked how the two hands adapted to these errors. Again, across the group there was a correlation between the asymmetry of error correction on one trial and the asymmetric shift in reaching direction on the next trial (\nFigure 2\n). The arm that corrected more learned more from the mistake. In an elegant twist, they then pre-exposed one hand or the other to a series of high errors, in a unimanual version of the task, before again testing the bimanual responses. Their results show that recent history of poor reaching performance is enough to bias the corrective responses and the learning towards the worse hand. We do force the bad arm to learn better, rather than rely on the good arm to do all the work.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nLearning to correct for motor errors.\nAcross a group of participants, asymmetry of corrections was correlated to the asymmetry of subsequent adaptation, with the non-dominant hand correcting and adapting more. Follow-up experiments demonstrated that this effect was dependent on the recent history of errors — the hand making more errors learns more. (Adapted from\nFinally, White and Diedrichsen\naddressed two alternative hypotheses to explain all these results. The motor system might bias responsibility for error to the arm for which it has less reliable information about performance. If predictions about the outcome of the dominant hand's action are better, because that hand is more reliable and more skilled, then ambiguous errors might be assigned to the less reliable, less predictable non-dominant hand (\nFigure 1\nA). And because prediction errors are an important training signal\n, the non-dominant hand would adapt more readily. Alternatively, the motor system might set the control gain higher for the less accurate hand, so that errors which are more likely to arise for that hand are more effectively corrected.\nWhite and Diedrichsen\nseparated these two hypotheses with an experimental analogue of a gust of wind catching the tennis ball: the visual target, not the cursor, was suddenly shifted at movement onset. Now neither arm was responsible for the error, so inequality in the certainty of the two-state estimates should not result in asymmetric corrections, whereas inequality in control gains should. It turns out that the asymmetry of the responses does appear to be due to differences in control gain. This is a bit counter-intuitive, as much recent theory of motor control has shifted towards a more dominant role for prediction and state estimation\n[10–12]\n. However, the change in control gains is selective. Pre-training with target jumps did not affect later responses to cursor rotations, and\nvice versa\nThis new paper\nis neat, and may alter the way neuroscientists think about issues of generalization of skills from one hand to another\n. It also opens some interesting new questions about neural representations in the motor system. We think the brain includes internal models that capture the response properties of the joints and muscles it controls\n, and probably has different models for different contexts — such as the behaviour of my arm with and without a tennis racquet in my hand. But do these models also code for the reliability of their internal estimates? Is the control gain set by this measure of reliability, so that a bad model has high gain, and must be pulled into line through a series of error corrections? Wolpert and Kawato\nsuggested that multiple internal models contribute to each motor command, combined according to their responsibility for control over the motor context. The model with high responsibility has more control. White and Diedrichsen's\nresults suggest an uncomfortable alternative: the models that are responsible for error, not for control, get the lion's share of the corrective task and of the learning that follows.\nReferences\nKording K.P., Wolpert D.M.

The primary objective of this study was to describe ioCS. A second aim was to identify risk factors of ioCS. We retrospectively analysed patients operated for small-bowel neuroendocrine tumour in our institution between 2007 and 2015, and receiving our preventive local regimen of octreotide continuous administration. ioCS was defined as highly probable in case of rapid (<5 min) arterial blood pressure changes ≥40%, not explained by surgical/anaesthetic management and regressive ≥20% after octreotide bolus injection. Probable cases were ioCS which did not meet all criteria of highly-probable ioCS. Suspected ioCS were detected on the anaesthesia record by an injection of octreotide due to a manifestation which did not meet the criteria for highly-probable or probable ioCS. A total of 81 patients (liver metastases: 59, prior carcinoid syndrome: 49, carcinoid heart disease: 7) were included; 139 ioCS occurred in 45 patients: 45 highly probable, 67 probable and 27 suspected. ioCs was hypertensive (91%) and/or hypotensive (29%). There was no factor, including the use of vasopressors, significantly associated with the occurrence of an ioCS. All surgeries were completed and one patient died from cardiac failure 4 days after surgery. After preoperative octreotide continuous infusion, ioCS were mainly hypertensive. No ioCS risk factors, including vasopressor use, were identified. No intraoperative carcinoid crisis occurred, suggesting the clinical relevance of a standardized octreotide prophylaxis protocol.\nKeywords:\ncarcinoids, neuroendocrine tumour, somatostatin\nIntroduction\nSmall-bowel neuroendocrine tumours (SB-NETs) are rare secreting neoplasms. Hormones (serotonin, histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandins and chromogranin-A) released into the systemic circulation can lead to a carcinoid syndrome (CS), which occurs in 10–20% of SB-NET patients. CS is characterized by isolated or associated symptoms such as cutaneous flushing (90%), diarrhoea (80%), abdominal pain (35%), bronchospasm (15%) and/or cardiovascular changes (hypo or hypertension, tachycardia or cardiac insufficiency (30%)) (\n). This syndrome can progress to a carcinoid crisis, a life-threatening complication combining severe hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrhythmias and failure and refractory bronchoconstriction (\n). Up to 40% of patients develop a carcinoid heart disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality (\nExpert groups recommend primary SB-NETs open surgical removal with partial bowel resection and lymphadenectomy even in the metastatic stages (>50% of cases at diagnosis) to prevent local complications and decrease tumour mass (\n). They also recommend the use of somatostatin analogues due to their anti-proliferative effect on SB-NETs and their antisecretory effect against CS (\nThe perioperative period is at high risk of intraoperative carcinoid syndrome (ioCS) as many triggering factors are present (\n). Hormone release can be caused by stress, hypoxemia, hypothermia, hypo or hypertension, pain, induction of anaesthesia, tumour manipulation and pharmacological agents, including anaesthetic drugs. Furthermore, vasopressor use has been suspected to trigger ioCS by promoting SB-NET hormone release and to result in paradoxical effects (\nHowever, only few studies reporting on the clinical presentation of ioCS have been published (\n). Thus, the primary endpoint of this study was to describe ioCS. The second aim was to identify risk factors of ioCS in patients operated of SB-NETs, receiving a continuous infusion of intravenous somatostatin analogue started from the preoperative period.\nMaterials and methods\nAfter approval by the ethics committee of our institution (Comité de protection des Personnes SUD-EST IV, Lyon), we retrospectively analysed a series of consecutive patients who underwent resection of SB-NET in our institution between January 2007 and December 2015. This study was approved by the national data protection commission (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés, CNIL) on 6 November 2015 (n°15-111). Consents have been obtained from patients after full explanation of the purpose and nature of data used. All patients receiving our local regimen of preoperative continuous octreotide were included. Patients operated for other neuroendocrine tumour location, hepatic metastases only or not receiving our octreotide administration regimen were not included.\nPerioperative octreotide administration\nOctreotide was administered 12–48 h prior to surgery by intravenous continuous infusion at a dose of 40 µg/h or 80 µg/h if patient had prior CS, hepatic metastases or carcinoid heart disease. Octreotide was continued during the intraoperative and postoperative periods at the same doses. IoCS were treated by additional intraoperative octreotide boluses (0.5–2 µg/kg) and surgical break.\nioCS definition\nHighly probable ioCS was defined as rapid (onset period ≤5 min) hemodynamic changes (heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP)) ≥40%, not explained by surgical or anaesthetic management and regressive ≥20% within 5 min after the octreotide bolus injection; probable ioCS was defined as cases for which manifestations did not meet all criteria of highly probable ioCS (onset period of 5–10 min and/or hemodynamic changes of 20–40% and/or no octreotide bolus and/or no reversibility of ≥20% after octreotide injection and/or confounding factors related to anaesthetic management). Suspected ioCS was detected on the anaesthesia record by an injection of octreotide for a manifestation which did not meet the criteria of highly-probable or probable ioCS.\nMedian variations of BP and HR from basal state to maximum and then during regression for each type of ioCS were collected. Carcinoid crisis was defined as a life-threatening ioCS refractory to octreotide boluses. Carcinoid crisis includes cardiogenic shock, severe cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest or bronchospasm refractory to bronchodilators and compromising mechanical ventilation.\nAnaesthetic management\nAll patients had preoperative assessment, including a transthoracic echocardiography at least 48 h prior to surgery. The day before surgery, premedication with antihistamines or gabapentin was prescribed if anxiety was 6 or more on a 10-point verbal numeric scale. After standard monitoring installation, anaesthesia was induced intravenously with propofol or etomidate, remifentanil and cisatracrium. Anaesthesia was maintained with desflurane delivered by control mode mechanical ventilation (Primus, Drägerwerk AG & Co. KGaA, Lübeck, Germany) and with a continuous infusion of remifentanil. Adequate muscle relaxation was obtained by intravenous cisatracrium boluses according to train-of-four monitoring. Two 16 or 18-G peripheral venous catheters and a triple lumen central venous line were inserted. An arterial catheter was inserted at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist as were transoesophageal Doppler (WAKI\nTO, Atys medical, Soucieu-en-Jarrest, France) and Bispectral index (BIS) (BIS, Covidien, Ilc, Mansfield, USA). Warming blankets were always used (3M Bair Hugger therapy, 3M Health Care, St. Paul, USA). Hypotensive episodes were treated by octreotide boluses and, if necessary, by ephedrine (0.10–0.15 mg/kg) or phenylephrine (1–2 µg/kg) boluses and then by norepinephrine intravenous continuous infusion starting at dose at 0.05 µg/kg/h.\nData collection\nThe following clinical parameters were recorded: age, gender, physical status ASA score, cardiovascular history (hypertension, cardiac failure), prior CS (flushing, diarrhoea, bronchospasm), prior carcinoid heart disease, hepatic and extra-abdominal metastases, elevated urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and the prior use of long-acting somatostatin analogues. Anaesthesia management with use of premedication, anaesthetic agents, and vasoactive drugs, as well as the timing of occurrence of ioCS during the surgical procedure, hemodynamic changes during ioCS, the type of surgical procedure and number of SB-NETs on histologic examination were recorded, as was death following carcinoid crisis.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables with a Gaussian distribution were reported as mean with standard deviation (\n) and compared with the Student\n-test, whereas continuous variables with a non-Gaussian distribution were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared using the Mann–Whitney test. Univariate analyses of potential ioCS risk factors were performed. Categorical variables were compared using a\nor Fisher exact test. A\nvalue ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 81 patients (42 males) underwent SB-NET surgery during the study period and were included. The mean (\n) age was 59 (\n) years. The ASA score was 1–2 for 65 patients, and 35 had a previous cardiovascular history. Among those, 49 patients had prior CS (diarrhoea 39, flushing 42, bronchospasm 1); seven patients had carcinoid heart disease and two patients a tricuspid valve replacement one year before abdominal surgery. Fifty-nine patients had hepatic metastases and seven an extra-abdominal location of NET. Urinary 5-HIAA levels were elevated for 40 patients. Octreotide protocol was started 21 (\n) hours before surgery and was respected for 64 patients (11 patients had a lower dose).\nAll patients underwent bowel resection, 79 with ileocolic anastomosis and 78 with lymphadenectomy. The median (IQR) number of tumours removed was 1 (\n). Hepatic resection was performed in 12 patients. The mean (\n) operative time was 300 (92) min. All tumours were confirmed to be SB-NET. Characteristics of intraoperative anaesthetic management are shown in\nTable 1\n. Sixty-five patients had premedication, with antihistamines in most of cases.\nTable 1.\nIntraoperative anaesthetic management.\nHypnotics\nEtomidate\nPropofol\nOpioids\nRemifentanil\nKetamine (antihyperalgesic dose)\nNeuromuscular blocking agent\nCisatracurium\nSuccinylcholine\nPostoperative analgesia\nMorphine\nLidocaine IVSE\nHaemodynamic monitoring\nArterial catheter\nTransoesophageal Doppler\nBispectral index\nVasopressor use\nEphedrine\nPhenylephrine\nNoradrenaline\nVolume expansion (mean ±\n, mL/kg/h)\nCrystalloid\n6.6 ± 2.2\nColloid\n0.7 ± 0.9\nAlbumin\nBlood transfusion (mean ±\nNumber of packed red blood cells\n2.5 ± 0.7\nUrinary output (mean ±\n, mL/kg/h)\n1.5 ± 1.1\nOpen in a new tab\nA total of 139 episodes of ioCS (highly probable, probable and suspected) occurred in 45 patients. The mean (\n) number of ioCS episodes per patient was 3 (\nFig. 1\n). Up to 11 ioCS occurred for two patients during surgery. IoCS was a hypertensive (91%, 41 patients, 107 episodes) and/or a hypotensive episode (29%, 13 patients, 32 episodes). Cutaneous flushing occurred in 3 patients. No episode of dysrhythmia or bronchospasm occurred. Time of occurrence of ioCS was tumour manipulation (\n= 37 patients, 82%), incision (\n= 8 patients, 18%) and anaesthetic induction (\n= 2 patients, 4%). No triggering factor of ioCS was identified for 11 (1/4) patients. Patients received a mean (\n) of 3 (\n) octreotide boluses during surgery. No side effects or cardiac conduction abnormality induced by octreotide injection occurred. BP and HR variation during ioCS were recorded (\nTable 2\n). BP changes during hypotensive episodes of ioCS were more pronounced on systolic arterial pressure than on mean and diastolic arterial pressure. There was no significant HR variation during ioCS.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nExample of individual recording of multiple intraoperative carcinoid syndromes during small-bowel neuroendocrine tumour surgery.\nTable 2.\nHemodynamic changes during hypertensive and hypotensive episodes of intraoperative carcinoid syndrome.\nVariations median % (IQR)\nHypertensive episode\nHypotensive episode\nHighly probable (\nProbable (\nSuspected (\nHighly probable (\nProbable (\nSuspected (\nSAP before ≥ during\n53 (44–64)\n35 (27–48)\n18 (5–33)\n49 (46–55)\n28 (24–49)\n10 (6–15)\nSAP during ≥ after\n24 (21–30)\n22 (14–30)\n8 (2–19)\n63 (47–81)\n28 (21–33)\n7 (2–15)\nMAP before ≥ during\n51 (45–63)\n35 (24–51)\n14 (4–3)\n24 (23–30)\n15 (9–19)\n3 (2–6)\nMAP during ≥ after\n31 (22–40)\n23 (15–33)\n3 (−1 to 12)\n49 (34–88)\n24 (14–33)\n5 (1–15)\nDAP before ≥ during\n49 (39–59)\n35 (22–50)\n9 (−1 to 31)\n16 (13–18)\n9 (6–13)\n2 (1–4)\nDAP during ≥ after\n24 (13–34)\n18 (8–24)\n1 (−2 to 8)\n48 (37–71)\n25 (10–34)\n5 (−1 to 18)\nHR before ≥ during\n11 (3–20)\n10 (2–16)\n1 (−3 to 8)\n3 (0–10)\n0 (−3 to 1)\n−1 (−2 to 0)\nHR during ≥ after\n3 (0–12)\n2 (−1 to 6)\n0 (−2 to 7)\n−2 (−14 to 1)\n2 (−3 to 9)\n0 (1–4)\nOpen in a new tab\nAmong probable ioCS, missing criteria to classify them as highly probable ioCS were, for hypertensive and hypotensive episodes respectively, hemodynamic changes ≤40% (57% and 73%), onset period between 5 and 10 min (14 and 9%), no octreotide injection (48 and 0%), reversibility ≤20% after octreotide injection (4 and 0%) and confounding factors with anaesthetic management (16 and 18%).\nThere was no factor, including the use of vasopressors, significantly associated with the occurrence of ioCS (\nTable 3\n). The analysis was repeated with patients who experienced only highly probable ioCS with the same result.\nTable 3.\nCharacteristics of patients according to occurrence of intraoperative carcinoid syndrome (ioCS).\nNo ioCS,\nAt least one ioCS,\nNumber\nPreoperative carcinoid syndrome\nDiarrhoea\nCutaneous flush\nCarcinoid heart disease\nHepatic metastases\nElevated preoperative output of 5-hydroxylindoleacetic acid (missing data = 17)\nPremedication with antihistamines\nIntraoperative vasopressors use\nEphedrine\nPhenylephrine\nNoradrenaline\nHepatic resection\nOpen in a new tab\nNo intraoperative carcinoid crisis occurred during the study period. All surgeries were completed. One patient died postoperatively, 4 days after surgery, developing a carcinoid crisis with a refractory cardiac failure and a cardiac arrest. He was a 74-year-old man who had a highly secreting tumour with a severe clinical presentation, an asymptomatic carcinoid heart disease, and hepatic metastases.\nDiscussion\nAfter preoperative continuous octreotide infusion, ioCS were mostly hypertensive and no ioCS risk factor was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first study that pre-defined ioCS in order to describe the occurrence and the risk factors of this complication.\nThere is no consensus for ioCS definition. Seymour\n. underlined the heterogeneity in the definition of ioCS and carcinoid crisis (\n). Moreover, clinical manifestations of ioCS under general anaesthesia can be modified and identifying this complication can be difficult. In addition, Bijker\net al.\nunderlined the difficulty to define intraoperative hypotension regarding the variability of definitions through studies depending on the threshold values, BP type (systolic vs mean BP), measurement interval and method (noninvasive vs invasive) and minimal episode duration (\n). It results in wide incidence of intraoperative hypotension and different associations between intraoperative hypotension and adverse outcomes. This suggests that a dynamic approach of intraoperative BP variations could be of clinical relevance, more than dichotomic thresholds. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyse ioCS as a dynamic phenomenon using a definition taking into account onset time, variation of BP or HR, reversibility after octreotide injection and absence of confounding factors with surgical or anaesthetic management.\nThe overall incidence of ioCS was higher than the previously published series (24–38%) (\n). However, the analysis of each episode reveals that incidence of ioCS could be lower. Indeed, some suspected ioCS may have incorrectly been recorded as ioCS. Clinical manifestations of ioCS contrast with other studies which report hypotensive episodes to be much more frequent. Indeed, Massimino\net al.\nreported a hypotensive episode for 19% of patients, defined as PAS <80 mmHg during ten minutes (\n). Condron\net al.\npublished a series of 127 patients with 30% of ioCS (76% of hypotensive and 7% of hypertensive episodes) (\n). One explanation could be the regimen of octreotide administration. There remains variability in practices regarding the timing and dosage of preoperative octreotide. Recommendations regarding octreotide infusion vary according to administration regimen, preoperative dose and infusion rate during surgery (\n). Different affinity with somatostatin receptors and a dose-dependent effect on hormone release could explain the different types of clinical manifestations.\nFew patients needed several injections (up to three boluses) to control ioCS suggesting the efficiency of low dose of octreotide. No intraoperative carcinoid crisis occurred and all surgeries were completed. Although continuous octreotide infusion is insufficient to prevent all ioCS, our local protocol seems to be effective to prevent carcinoid crisis, the most feared complication.\nNo factor was statistically associated with occurrence of ioCS. In 1/4 of cases, no triggering factor was found suggesting that ioCS can occur at any time and that anaesthetists should be constantly ready to treat hemodynamic instability. The small sample size is likely to be a major limitation for the identification of predictive factors. However, another explanation could be related to the protocol used that includes a double dose of octreotide in case of preoperative CS, hepatic metastases, or carcinoid heart disease, which may have reduced the risk of ioCS in such patients to that of other patients. Some reports suggest that vasopressor use can trigger ioCS and recommend to avoid this medication (\n). This is controversial and many studies have reported safety with vasopressor use (\n). The results herein suggest that intraoperative use of vasopressor in CS patients is safe to treat hypotension without paradoxical effects. The results also suggest that systematic premedication with antihistamines to decrease anxiety and stress in order to avoid hormone release is useless.\nThe study has some limitations. First, it was a single-centre study, but this design allowed for homogeneous surgical procedure and anaesthetic management. These results are related to our local protocol of octreotide and they could be different with other octreotide administration protocols. Second, our definition of ioCS was developed by an experienced anaesthetist team, but it can be discussed. We did not include duration of each ioCS. The analysis of hypertensive episodes reveals an increase of BP ≥50% during highly probable ioCS. This threshold for diagnosis of ioCS could be decreased considering ioCS classified as probable because of a variation of BP lower than 40%. Thus, a better definition of ioCS is needed but requires validation in a prospective multicentric study. Third, the retrospective nature of this study did not allow for a deep assessment of postoperative complications. Thus, the impact of ioCS on outcomes, as Condron and Massimino\net al.\nreported was not feasible (\n). In addition, a lack of power due to the relatively small sample size did not facilitate the identification of ioCS risk factors.\nIn conclusion, when a preoperative continuous octreotide infusion is administered to patients, ioCS are mainly hypertensive. No ioCS risk factors, including vasopressor use, were identified. A standardized octreotide prophylaxis protocol seems to be clinically relevant to manage ioCS and to prevent occurrence of carcinoid crisis.\nDeclaration of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sector.\nAuthor contribution statement\nContributed to the design of the work, acquisition of data: M F, Y B, M-C L, J P, F M, P S, F C, D H S, A P, G P , T W, T R.

This study aimed to find and make record of plants that are used for medicinal therapy by three communities living in Cherangani Hills. So far no single study has documented medicinal plants as a whole in the area. Ethnobotanical data were obtained through interviewing informants using semi-structured questionnaires and extracting information from journals and books. Descriptive statistical analysis was applied to describe the data. Overall 296 plant species from 80 families and 191 genera were identified. Asteraceae family was the most dominant, representing 10.7% of the total plant species recorded. Roots (35.9%) represented the most commonly used parts of the plant. The commonly used method of preparation was decoction (54.9%). The reported diseases were classified into 14 diverse ailment groups out of the 81 health conditions on their underlying user reports. Rural communities in Cherangani Hills are rich sources of plants with medicinal properties. Therapeutic uses of the compiled plants provide basic information that can aid scientists to conduct additional research dedicated to conservation of species and pharmacological studies of species with the greatest significance.\nKeywords:\nCherangani Hills, ethnobotanical, medicinal plants, decoction, informants, ailment categories, conservation\n1. Introduction\nMedicinal plants have been a vital source of both curative and preventive medical therapy preparations for human beings, which also has been used for the extraction of important bioactive compounds [\n]. It is estimated that almost 80% of the world’s total population, regularly, depends on traditional medicine and products for its healthcare needs especially in third world countries. Many sick people in the developing regions combine the conventional medicine with traditional medicine [\n]. Rural dwellers prefer traditional medicines because of their close proximity to the traditional healers and the fact that the healers understand their culture and environment as well as their patients. In rural areas, access to western healthcare is a problem especially in the Sub-Saharan countries, because conventional healthcare is concentrated in towns [\n]. Plant medicine has continuously been practiced for a long period, especially in some African tribes with a long history [\n]. The Kenyan diversified flora with over 7000 plant species is one of the richest in East Africa [\n]. Consequently, the higher number of plant species have led to discovery of many medicinal plants in the region. In Kenya, more than 70% of the people use local home-made remedies as their first source of medicine, while more than 90% use plant related remedies at one time or another [\n]. Phytotherapy is another fundamental part of the native communities of Kenya who have vital indigenous knowledge acquired through generations. However, this practice is often less transferred owing to industrialization and adoption of western life style. Traditional knowledge in many Kenyan ethnic tribes remain untapped since the medicinal plants have not been fully documented as the information is passed orally from one generation to the other posing danger of its loss [\n]. In Kenya, research on ethnobotany has been on going after independence and several publication of guides and books have been published [\n]. Recording and preserving the traditional knowledge on medicinal plants has become very important practice in recent times [\n]. Several ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological research studies have been published documenting Kenya’s medicinal plant knowledge and use: Marakwet county [\n], Northern Kenya [\n], Siaya county [\n], Tugen [\n], Machakos county [\n], Samburu county [\n], Sekanani Valley, Maasai Mara [\n], Kajiado county [\n], Embu and Mbeere county [\n], Makueni county [\n], Mount Elgon [\n], Nakuru county [\n], Nandi county [\n], Tharaka Nithi county [\n], Kakamega county [\n], Kitui county [\n], Elgeyo Marakwet county [\n], Kericho county [\n], Machakos county [\n], Narok county [\n], Trans-Mara county [\n], Kilifi county [\n]. However, in Kenya, many areas and ethnic societies are yet to be ethno botanically surveyed.\nThis study focused on three communities in Cherangani Hills and the medicinal plants used to treat different ailments. The documentation of the natural resources is key as it will assist in the conservation of residual and remaining forests [\n]. The databases obtained in this research forms a foundation for potential development of new medicines [\n]. Ethnobotanical investigations are vital in preserving traditional medicine through suitable documentation of plants, which also assist in its sustainability [\n]. Previous studies have been carried out in sections of Cherangani hills hence this research aimed to cover medicinal plants in the entire study region.\n2. Material and Methods\n2.1. Study Area\nThis study covered the human settlement areas around and adjacent to the Cherangani Hills forest ecosystem found in the western side of Kenya (\nFigure 1\n). Cherangani Hills reserve (35°26′ E, 1°16′ N), cuts across three counties, namely Trans Nzoia (1551 Ha), Elgeyo-Marakwet (74,249 Ha), and West Pokot (34,380 Ha), totaling 110,181 Ha, and is occupied by three ethnic groups comprising Luhya, Marakwet, and Pokot people respectively. The hills comprise 12 forest blocks where medicinal plant resources were collected and include Kipkunurr, Kapolet, Sogotio, Chemurkoi, Kaisungor, Cheboyit, Embobut, Kererr, Kiptaberr, Kapkanyar, Toropket, and Lelan [\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nCherangani hills forest Ecosystem. (\n) Map of Kenya (\n) the distribution of Cherangani hills.\n2.2. Selection of Respondents\nPurposive sampling was applied in the field investigation, where traditional therapists and elders helped to pin point medicinal plant practitioners and emphasis was laid on both women and men [\n]. Seventy-eight practitioners (38 women and 40 men) were sampled near each of the 12 forest block locations. Selected group of respondents were distinguished in the region because of their long tradition in providing services allied to traditional health remedies. Fifty-one practitioners were traditional healers and the remaining number were village elders who had acquired familiarity on medicinal healing skills of plants from their parents and close relatives.\n2.3. Ethnobotanical Data Collection and Plant Identification\nEthnobotanical information were gathered between September 2017 and January 2019 by interviewing, using methodological ways designed in ethnopharmacological in field data collection. The local chiefs were informed afore about the initiation of the survey and permission was allowed. Interviews, discussions, formal and informal conversations, as well as field visits were conducted [\n]. More information was sourced from literature studies including journal articles and books [\n]. Botanical names, local names, diseases treated, method of preparation, dosage, and modes of administration were recorded. An interview was carried in the local dialect and translated to English. Data on habit, habitat, and plant parts used were recorded. For each described plant species, a specimen was taken and preliminary identification was performed in the field. The specimens were pressed, dried, and the identification results were confirmed at the East African herbarium. A specimen voucher number was given and prepared for each collected herbarium specimen and deposited in the East African Herbarium (\nSupplementary material Table S1\n). Authentication of identified plant specimens was verified using the Flora of East African by comparisons with authenticated specimens at the East African Herbarium (EA), Nairobi, Kenya. The scientific names indicated in\nSupplementary material 1\n, in this research work are the recognized names according to “The plant List” database.\n2.4. Data Analysis\n2.4.1. Informant Consensus Factor\nInformant consensus factor (ICF) was computed using a mathematical expression: ICF = (N\n− 1), where N\nrefers to the summed up number of citations for each disease group and N\nis the number of plant species used in that category [\n]. The lowest ICF value is 0.00 and the highest is 1.00. Low ICF values indicates that informants do not agree on which plant medicine to use in a particular ailment, while high ICF values indicate that a limited number of plant species are known to be administered by a large number of informants to treat a specific disease. High ICF values can further be investigated and used to find species of important bioactive compounds [\n2.4.2. Fidelity Level (FL)\nFidelity level (FL) is the total number of informants who referenced the consumption of some medicinal plants to treat a specific disease in the region and is calculated by the following formula: FL = Np/N × 100, where Np represents total number of informants citing the use of the plant to be administered to a particular disease and N denotes the total number of informants who utilized the plants as a medicine group [\n]. Plant species with a higher percentage of FL shows the frequency and high usage in healing a specific disease by the informants in the community and vice versa when the percentage is low.\n2.4.3. Jaccard’s Coefficient of Similarity (JCS)\nJaccard’s coefficient of similarity (JCS) was computed to compare the medicinal plant composition and their similarity with other counties in Kenya. Similarity values were computed between other areas already studied by other researchers in different regions in comparison with the present study area. JCS, was calculated as: JCS = c/(a + b + c), a representing the total number of medicinal plant species obtained in area A, b is the total number of medicinal plant species discovered only in area B, and c is the total number of common plant species occurring in areas A and B [\n3. Results\n3.1. Demographic Profile of Respondents\nA total of 40 (51.2%) males and 38 females (48.7%) were interviewed. The results between male and female informants were almost equal. The lowest age of informants was 15 and the highest 85 years, with the highest modal class being (66–75) years, representing 30.8%. The frequency of other age class include, 15–25 (1.3%), 26–35 (3.9%), 36–45 (6.4%), 46–55 (12.8%), 56–65 (19.2%), 66–75 (30.8%), >76–85 (25.6%) (\nTable 1\n). Illiterate (42.1%), Primary (33.3%), Secondary (21.8%), Tertiary (2.7%) (\nTable 1\nTable 1.\nDemographic data of the informants around Cherangani Hills.\nExpected Mean Observation\nStatistics\nGender\nvalue 0.820847\nFemale\nvalue < 0.001\nEducational status *\nvalue < 0.001\nilliterate\nprimary\nsecondary\ntertiary\nOpen in a new tab\n* Significant difference (\n< 0.05) between the averages of paired categories.\n3.2. Diversity of Medicinal Plant Use\nThis study compiled 296 medicinal plants traditionally managing various human diseases (\nSupplementary material Table S1\n) resulting to 80 families and 191 genera. The largest percentage of medicinal plants obtained belonged to the family Asteraceae (32 species), followed by Leguminosae (28), Lamiaceae (18), Rubiaceae (14), Euphorbiaceae (12), Apocynaceae (10), Malvaceae (10), and Anacardiaceae (8). The result revealed that species in Leguminosae family contained the highest percentage (8.7%) in treating different ailments. This was followed by Asteraceae (7.7%), Lamiaceae (6.1%), Rutaceae, Anacardiaceae (4.6% each), and with the rest of the families treated less than 4.2% of the ailments (\nTable 2\nTable 2.\nHighest families and genera of medicinal plants.\nFamily\nSpecies\nGenera\nGenera\nFamily\nSpecies\nAsteraceae\nAcacia\nLeguminosae\nLeguminosae\nVernonia\nVernonia\nLamiaceae\nCrotalaria\nLeguminosae\nRubiaceae\nAnacardiaceae\nEuphorbiaceae\nMaytenus\nCelastraceae\nApocynaceae\nSolanum\nSolanaceae\nMalvaceae\nHelichrysum\nAsteraceae\nAnacardiaceae\nDombeya\nMalvaceae\nAmaranthaceae\nMoraceae\nCelastraceae\nPolygonum\nPolygonaceae\nSolanaceae\nOpen in a new tab\n3.3. The Habitat for Medicinal Plants\nThe most common plant habitat identified was bushland 20.0%, followed by escarpment 17.9%, highland forest 14.8%, grassland forest 13.8%, woodland 9.5%, riverine 7.4%, valley 6.2%, cultivated 4.8%, wooded grassland 2.9% and forest margins at 2%.\nFigure 2\nconstitutes the habitats of medicinal plant species, of Cherangani hills, consequently a high plant diversity for the production of roots, bark, leaves, fruits, and flowers as medicinal resources.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nPlant habitats for medicinal plants of Cherangani Hills.\n3.4. Habit, Parts Used for Medicine and Methods of Preparation\nGrowth habit of shrubs have the highest percentage of 35.1% of the total medicinal plants in this study. Total of 27.5% of trees are represented by the total number plant species (\nFigure 3\na), followed by herbs (26.5%), climbers (10%), epiphytes, and parasites with 0.3% each. The plant parts used include roots (35.9%), leaves (34.9%), bark (15.0%), fruits (5.2%), branches (5.0%), whole plant (1.9%), flowers (1.1%), seeds (0.2%), and barks of roots (0.2%) (\nFigure 3\nb). People living in the study area use different methods to prepare different medicines for treatment of different ailments. Decoction (boiling) proved to be used more commonly as the mode of preparation (53.3%), followed by pounding/crushing (24.5%), and chewing (9.3%). Other preparation methods represented less than 5% (\nFigure 4\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\n) Medicinal plant habit, (\n) plant parts for herbal preparation around Cherangani Hills.\nFigure 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nPreparation methods for medicinal plants.\n3.5. Informant Consensus Factor (ICF)\nTo obtain the accurate ICF, the reported diseases were grouped into 14 different ailment groups out of the 81 health conditions based on their use reports (\nTable 3\n). The results of the reported ailments are as follows; digestive system disorders (25.2%), respiratory tract infections (18.3%), parasitic diseases (17.9%) (\nTable 3\n). Stomachache (8.9%), malaria (6.7%), aphrodisiac (6%), coughing (4.8%), and abdominal pains (3.4%) were the most common disease mentioned. Within the three major disease groups, digestive system disorders had 139 use-reports, followed by respiratory tract infections (101) and parasitic diseases and other infections (99) use-reports. The greatest ICF (0.79) was mostly for metabolic disorders, followed by gynecological issues (0.76). Respiratory tract infections, erectile dysfunctions, and impotence were less frequently and had the lowest IFC of 0.27 and 0.18 respectively.\nTable 3.\nInformant consensus factors for categorized ailments.\nAilment Categories\nSpecific Conditions\nNumber of Used Reports\n% of Total Species\nNo. of Taxa\nDigestive system disorders\nUlcers, diarrhea, stomachache, dysentery, constipation, low appetite, nausea, purgative, intestinal worms, gastrointestinal disorders, amoeba.\nRespiratory tract infections\nCold, cough, respiratory infections, asthma, bronchitis, flue, sore throat, tuberculosis\nParasitic diseases and other infections\nMalaria, fever, measles, headache, yellow fever, ear, conjunctivitis, toothache, mouth blisters eye infections\nErectile dysfunctions and importance\nMale sexual vitality, aphrodisiac\nGynecological issues\nFertility enhancer, heavy menstrual flows, uterine cleansing, weakness during pregnancy, induction of labor, sterility in women, induce pregnancy, removing placenta, regulation of monthly periods, abortion, after birth pains, menstrual pains\nSkin infections\nWounds, burns, smallpox, ringworms, warts, skin rashes, leprosy, astringent, boils\nCirculatory system diseases\nHypertension, anemia, cuts, hemorrhoids, blood cleanser, hemorrhage, heart attack reduce bleeding, edema.\nBlood and Urinary system disorders\nUrinary infections, kidney inflammations.\nPoisonous and animal bites\nSnake, centipede and insect bites\nMuscular-skeletal problems inflammation\nBackache, joint pains, rheumatism, fractures, joints inflammation, swollen body parts.\nNeurological and nervous System disorders\nConvulsions, epilepsy, memory and neurological disorders, madness reduction.\nGenital apparatus diseases\nGenital organs infection, sterility, infertility, prostate infections, syphilis, and gonorrhea\nMetabolic disorders\nLiver diseases, hepatic.\nCancers\nBreast cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer\nOpen in a new tab\n3.6.

Jaccard’s Coefficient of Similarity\nThis study represents the first scientific documentation of ethnobotanical uses of 296 medicinal plant used by the three communities in Cherangani hills. The current report on the ethnomedicinal uses of plants was compared to those of previous studies done in other regions of Kenya (\nTable 5\n). It was found that Marakwet (18%), Sungurur (16%), and Keiyo (14%) had the highest Jaccard’s coefficient of similarity in the makeup of medicinal plant species whereas the degree of similarity was lower in areas like Nandi (0.05%) and Kitui (0.06%) (\nTable 5\nTable 5.\nA comparison of medicinal plants within the study area and those in other extents.\nStudy Area (County)\nYear of Study\nSpecies No. (x and y)\nCommon Species (z)\nJaccard’s Coefficient\n% Similarity\nReferences\nCherangani\nThis review\nMachakos\nKakamega\nKakamega\nSungurur\nMakueni\nTharaka Nithi\nMarakwet\nKakamega\nMt.

Threats to Medicinal Plants\nInformants’ responses showed that many factors have contributed to the threats faced by plants of medicinal importance in the study area. (\nTable 6\n). Agricultural expansion (38.5%) was the main threat to important medicinal species, followed by overgrazing (20.5%), overharvesting (17.9%), firewood and Charcoal production (10.3%), environmental degradation (7.7%). Some respondents pointed out that other threats exist within the study area that are a result of deforestation and loss of habitat (5.1%).\nTable 6.\nThreats to medicinal plants in Cherangani Hills.\nThreats\nFrequency (N = 78)\nPercentage (%)\nAgricultural expansion\nOvergrazing\nOverharvesting\nFirewood and Charcoal production\nEnvironmental degradation\nOthers\nOpen in a new tab\n4. Discussion\nThe communities around Cherangani hills forest reserve use a large diversity of flora in the treatment of a myriad of diseases and the native people have a broad traditional knowledge on plants of medicinal importance. The higher percentage of people that rely on medicinal plants could be attributed to the high cost of western medicine and inaccessibility of government medical facilities [\n]. There was an insignificant difference between men and women in the knowledge of medicinal plants. Comparing with other study area in Kenya [\n], there was no gender preference in the passing of medicinal plants knowledge from the parents to their offspring across local communities around Cherangani Hills. Informants in the age group above 45 years appeared to know more medicinal plants perhaps as a result of having more experience interacting with medicinal plants in their ecosystem. Additionally, fewer medicinal plants were known to those who attended tertiary levels of education compared to illiterate informants. The insignificant use of the plants of medicinal importance by the literates in the community can be attributed to lack of general preparation procedures and scientific information on their efficiency as well as their toxicity levels. Additionally, the collection as well as storage methods were identified as essential considerations by the literate members in the community. This indicates that there exists a generational disjunction in the passage of traditional medicinal plant knowledge. This can be linked to the influence of formal education as it was observed that illiterate informants had an upper hand in medicinal plants knowledge as compared to their tertiary level counterparts. Exposure of younger people to modern education and lifestyle has led them to prefer western medical treatment over traditional medicine hence despising medicinal plant treatments compared to those unexposed and uneducated [\n]. Leaves are also highly utilized because they are obtained easily in large quantities in contrast to other plant parts. Moreover, a majority of traditional healers prefer to use leaves as they are considered to accumulate active ingredients by photosynthetic pigments such as alkaloids and tannins [\nA myriad of methods of preparation are used within the three communities of Cherangani Hills and Kenya as a whole. In the study area it was uncovered that decoction was the most widely used method of preparation mainly because of the ease of using water to prepare them. Such a large variety of preparation methods that have been studied has been highlighted in some parts of Kenya and in other countries [\n]. It has been established that more than one method is used in preparing many of the medicinal plants studied. However, the type of plant species, condition of ailment being treated, and plant parts used determined the method of preparation. Within the Marakwet, Luhya, and Pokot communities, the common way of administration of the prepared medicine was through drinking, which is in line with many other studies [\nGastrointestinal ailments were the most frequently treated using medicinal plant followed by sensory-neuron diseases. In similar fashion, disorders of the gastrointestinal system and parasitic infections were the commonly treated ailments and similar results have been reported in Kenya and Zegie peninsula [\n]. Stomachache and diseases related to digestive system could be attributed to poor sanitation as a result of high levels of poverty within the study region as in the case cited by other studies [\n]. High FL of a species in the scope of this study shows the extensive use of a particular plant species to treat certain diseases by the inhabitants because of its ease of accessibility and its effectiveness to treat the diseases. Such information may lead to the efficacy of these plants and their chemical and pharmacological components of the reported activity against various diseases. For example,\nCarissa spinarum\nL. with FL = 90.5 is good for treating malaria. The plant contains important bioactive constituents including glycosides, acids, saponins, tannins, terpenoids, and alkaloids which have medicinal value [\n]. Within the area studied,\nCarissa spinarum\nL. is mainly used in treating malaria, chest pains, epilepsy, diarrhea, coughs, breast cancer, arthritis, and gonorrhea.\nDifferent ecological climatic conditions have been characterized with different plant diversity, hence pointing to some of the probable reasons for similarities and differences of plants of medicinal value found in our study area and other extents. Data collected and analyzed from the region of study reveal remarkable differences in parts of the plant used, preparation mode of herbal medicine and their use as has been documented in other regions. However, 82% of medicinal applications were new and unique to the study at hand.\nThe use of medicinal plant species recorded in the same study area had 14%, 16%, and 18% JCS respectively and the neighboring areas like Kakamega [\n] showed remarkable similarity at, 12%, 12%, and 13% JCS respectively. There was close resemblance in terms of the usage of medicinal plants because of close proximity to the research area.\nThreatened medicinal plant species recorded in this study include\nWarburgia ugandensis\nSprague. (VU) and\nAnsellia africana\nLindl. (VU). The rest of the medicinal plants are either data deficient (DD), not evaluated (NE), or of least concern (LC), by IUCN. Many factors have been associated with the dangers faced by the medicinal plants in the study region. Informants’ insights show that the main threats to plants of medicinal value were forest encroachment for agricultural expansion, overharvesting, overgrazing, and environmental degradation (\nTable 6\n). Majority of the respondents indicated that agricultural activity (38.5%) was a significant danger to the existence of medicinal plants and their conservation because of an increase in human population. Some respondents pointed out that medicinal plants within the area of study had other threats as a result of deforestation and loss of habitat. A study by Mutwiwa [\n] also listed overgrazing, charcoal burning, and environmental degradation as some of the threats faced by the plants of medicinal value in Machakos County, Mwala sub-county, Kenya. From our assessment in the course the field investigations, it was further noted that none of the listed medicinal plants were cultivated by the communities.\n5. Conclusions\nPlanting fast-growing plant species for the production of charcoal would greatly help in lowering the harvesting of medicinal plants and enhance the conservation of vulnerable plant species. Proper grazing management of domestic animals should be enforced by the authorities in the forest reserves to reduce overgrazing especially in the areas of the forest that are more susceptible to overgrazing like the forest periphery. Proper harvesting regulations should be implemented and followed to reduce overharvesting and overexploitation of medicinal plants especially those species that are used more frequently to treat common ailments. This study provides a detailed report and an appreciation of medicinal knowledge among the three communities around the Cherangani Hills. The awareness of the importance of medicinal plants in human healthcare is important as scientific evaluation promises their future use in the development of new drugs for emerging diseases. The information on medicinal plants, dosages, and the ailments treated might be heavily eroded in the days to come because of the observed poor record keeping and the increasing use of western medication. This inventory therefore can be used as a source of information for the conservation agencies to enable proper management of plant biodiversity and its resources.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are in gratitude to the Kenya Forest Service and National Environment and Management Authority for enabling the access to permits that empowered us to take on botanical investigations in the Cherangani Hills Forest.

This technology eliminates the need for soil and reduces water usage by providing nutrients straight to the\nplant's roots. The Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and automation are all used in \"smart farming,\" which allows for constant monitoring of\nsoil conditions, nutrient levels, and plant vitality to facilitate fine-grained management and optimization. The technology-driven strategy\nimproves crop output, quickens growth rates, and keeps conditions ideal all year round regardless of weather or other environmental\ncircumstances. In addition, smart farming lessens the need for organic chemical inputs, promotes environmentally safe methods of pest\nmanagement, and minimizes the amount of waste produced. This ground-breaking strategy may significantly alter the agricultural sector\nby encouraging regionalized food production, enhancing food security, and adding to more resilient farming practices. This comprehensive\nreview delves into current trends in Hydroponics, highlighting recent advancements in smart farming systems, such as Domotics, Data\nAcquisition, Remote Cultivation, and automated AI systems. The review also underscores the various types and advantages of smart\nfarming hydroponic technology, emphasizing the requirements for achieving efficiency in this innovative domain. Additionally, it explores\nfuture goals and potential developments, paving the way for further advancements in hydroponic smart farming.\nKeywords:\nSmart Farming, Hydroponics, IoT, Sensors, Domotics, Remote Cultivation, Data Acquisition, Future smart farming\nBackground:\nHydroponics is the practice of growing plants in a nutrient-rich water solution instead of soil [\nThe term \"hydroponics\" originated from the Greek- \"hydro,\" which means water, and \"ponos,\" which means labour [\nPeat moss, charcoal, gravel, rock wool, perlite, coco peat, and coconut coir are only some of the inert media used in hydroponic\nsystems to support plant roots [\n]. The system may\nbe engineered to give the plants the optimal quantity of water, nutrients, and oxygen for optimal development. Hydroponic systems are\nused commercially and in private homes to cultivate a wide variety of plant life, including vegetables, fruits, herbs, and flowers.\nWhile the concept of soilless growing has been around for millennia, the modern hydroponic system was developed in the middle of the\n20th century as a solution to boost food production in locations with limited resources and space [\nIt is believed that the Hanging Gardens were created utilizing the first known application of hydroponic cultivation\n]. To prove that plants might grow successfully without soil, a Flemish botanist named Jan\nvan Helmont undertook experiments in the 17th century. Later, in 1800, French scientists De Saussure and Boussingault proved that\nplants require carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen for proper growth. Subsequently, in 1860, German scientists Sachs and Knop\nadded to De Saussure and Boussingault's list by cultivating plants in aqueous solutions including salts of phosphorus, sulphur,\npotassium, calcium, and magnesium [\n]. William\nFrederick Gericke is often cited as an early proponent of growing plants without soil. Because he believed it would be more efficient\nand successful, Gericke focused on developing methods for cultivating plants without soil. Using lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers as\nexamples, he conducted a slew of experiments demonstrating that plants could grow and flourish in nutrient-rich water so long as\ntheir fundamental nutritional demands were met. The concept of soilless agriculture owes a great deal to Gericke's research, which\nalso laid the framework for modern Hydroponics [\n]. Hydroponics is now widely utilized in\ncommercial and domestic settings to cultivate various products, from leafy greens to tuber crops to tomatoes and herbs. Its promise\nto boost food production and sustainability, decrease water consumption, and raise crop yields has recently increased in popularity\nImportance and relevance of Hydroponics in urban farming:\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization's report in 2001, it is projected that the global population will reach 9.7\nbillion by 2050. This will require a 60% rise in the production of food worldwide. The current state of under nourishment has found to\naffect around 11% of the global population, and there has been an upward trend in this figure in recent times. As though, food\nsecurity has emerged as a prominent concern in the current era, representing a critical challenge for the agricultural sector\n[Tilman, 2002] [\nFurthermore, the number of malnourished individuals stands at approximately 690 million. According to research, livestock farming\nutilizes around 80% of the global agricultural land, necessitating significantly more land than plant-based food farming. According to\nresearch, approximately 30% of the global food supply is wasted annually [\n]. According to\nrecent data, most of the world's population resides in urban areas, surpassing the number of individuals living in rural regions.\nSpecifically, in 2018, cities accommodated 55% of the global population [\n]. According to\nanother study, the percentage of the global population residing in urban areas was 30% in 1950 [\nHowever, projections indicate that by 2050, this figure is expected to increase to 68% [\nEven though, urban populations have been rapidly increasing, nevertheless, agriculture has been able to meet their growing demands by\nproducing food that requires higher energy, land, water, and generates increased greenhouse gas emissions. The primary concern lies in\nwhether agriculture can sustainably keep up with the changing demands of urban populations while also promoting agricultural\nprosperity and reducing poverty in both rural and urban regions [\n]. When taking the\nperspective of urbanisation and limiting the poverty, focusing on smart farming is a far more effective way to reduce poverty than\ninvesting in other areas, as agriculture has given its pivotal role in a country's infrastructure and its potential impact on\nconflicts and wars which were driven by historical land-related food disputes [\n]. Such that\nthe expansion of urban areas creates competition for resources such as soil, water, and labour with agriculture. This could be\nattributed to the influx of people and the reclassification of land use [\n]. The competition\nfor limited resources has led to a situation where advanced agriculture is required to increase its productivity to addressing the\nissue on diminishing the burden of poverty chain and simultaneously combating demand of land and climate change concerns\nHydroponics, however, is a crucial feature of contemporary farming, especially in the context of \"smart farming.\" It offers some\nbenefits and addresses serious problems with traditional agricultural methods. Hydroponics has several advantages over conventional\nagricultural techniques like using soil and greenhouses. Hydroponics allows for economical water consumption, typically using as much\nas 90% less water than conventional farming methods [\n]. Hydroponics, with its carefully\ncalibrated nutrient solutions, may produce far greater quantities of greens than conventional soil gardening [\nHydroponics also allows for greater crop output per unit area because of its vertical farming methodology, which makes the most\n]. It was recorded that there was a significant decrease\nin photosynthetic photon flux density and shoot fresh weight in the Vertical Farming Systems [VFS] as the distance from the apex to\nthe foundation increased. However, despite this reduction, the VFS generated a greater amount of crop per unit of cultivation space\ncompared to the horizontal hydroponic system [\n]. The study's findings indicate that VFS may\nbe a viable substitute for horizontal hydroponic development mechanisms.\nAdditionally, the study suggests that integrating artificial lighting into the VFS may lead to even higher yields. Pests and\nillnesses are less likely to be a problem with hydroponic systems, lowering the demand for chemical pesticides [\nFinally, Hydroponics allows for continuous production throughout the year independent of external weather conditions, guaranteeing a\nsteady supply of fresh vegetables [\n]. Hydroponics often provides a better Return On\nInvestment [ROI] than conventional farming methods because of its greater productivity and quicker harvest times [\nResearch findings indicate that hydroponic lettuce production has the potential to generate significantly higher yields per acre in\ncomparison to soil-based cultivation, with reported increases of up to 20 times. The enhanced productivity observed in hydroponic\nfarming systems has been found to result in improved financial returns and a faster return on investment. Compared to conventional\nagricultural methods, hydroponic systems may increase lettuce yields by as much as 20 times per acre [\nBrault et al., conducted a study on the year-round production of lettuce using the nutrient film technique in a greenhouse with\nartificial lighting to investigate the feasibility of using this technique to produce lettuce throughout the year, which involved the\nuse of a greenhouse with artificial lighting to provide the necessary light and the nutrient film technique to provide the necessary\nnutrients to the plants. The study's findings indicated that hydroponic lettuce farming in a controlled environment enables\nuninterrupted and reliable year-round crop yield, thus surmounting any seasonal constraints [\nBy implementing a controlled environment and precise nutrient management, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of achieving\nuninterrupted tomato production regardless of external weather conditions, facilitating year-round market supply [\nThe researchers achieved continuous pepper production throughout the year by maintaining optimal environmental conditions, including\ntemperature, light, and nutrient supply [\n]. In another study, the research findings indicate\nthat implementing hydroponic cultivation methods and regulated environmental factors enabled uniform strawberry yield, irrespective of\nseasonal constraints [\n]. These benefits demonstrate the practicality and longevity of\ngrowing hydroponically-cultivated leafy greens.\nAdvantages of hydroponic farming System:\nResource Efficiency: The optimization of resources like water, nutrients, and space is a key benefit of Hydroponics. Hydroponic\nfarming techniques have been found to reduce water usage by up to 90% compared to conventional soil-based farming. Additionally, this\nmethod allows for the recycling and reutilization of nutrient solutions, promoting sustainability and minimizing waste. The\nimplementation of vertical farming techniques has been found to optimize space utilization, resulting in the ability to achieve\nhigh-density crop production [\nYear-Round Crop Production:\nHydroponics allows for cultivation throughout the year without being affected by seasonal or climatic constraints. Growers can\nutilize controlled environments to establish the ideal conditions for plant growth, encompassing temperature, humidity, light\nintensity, and nutrient concentrations. Maintaining a consistent and dependable food supply, decreasing reliance on imported goods,\nand improving food security are all important factors to consider [\nIncreased Crop Yields:\nResearch has shown that hydroponic systems accurately regulate growth conditions, leading to increased plant growth rates and\ngreater crop yields than traditional farming techniques. Research has shown that customizing nutrient delivery and optimizing the root\nzone environment can improve plant health and productivity. [\nEnvironmental Sustainability:\nThe utilization of Hydroponics has been found to reduce the adverse effects of agriculture. The elimination of soil dependency\nresults in a reduction of soil erosion, loss of nutrients, and spoilage. Integrating Hydroponics with sustainable practices, such as\norganic pest control, water recycling, and renewable energy sources, can contribute to a more environmentally friendly approach to\nfarming [\nNutritional Quality and Flavour:\nThe precise control of nutrient levels and growing conditions in hydroponic cultivation can improve crop quality and flavour.\nHydroponic cultivation can be particularly noteworthy for speciality crops, herbs, and medicinal plants due to the potential to\noptimize specific compounds and active ingredients. [\nPest and Disease Control:\nHydroponics provides a soil-less environment, reducing the risk of soil-borne pests and diseases. Integrated Pest Management [IPM]\ntechniques can be implemented more effectively in Hydroponics, utilizing biological controls and minimizing the need for chemical\npesticides. This leads to healthier plants and safer produce [\n]. Urban Agriculture and Local\nFood Production: Research suggests that Hydroponics is a suitable method for urban agriculture as it allows food production in\nconfined spaces such as rooftops, vertical farms, or indoor facilities. Promoting local food production has been found to positively\nreduce transportation distances and improve access to fresh, regionally produced crops. Strengthening local involvement and knowledge\nabout sustainable food systems is also observed [\n]. Scientific Research and Innovation:\nHydroponics is a platform for scientific research and innovation in agriculture. Researchers can explore new techniques, develop\nimproved cultivars, and test novel approaches for sustainable food production. Integrating smart technologies, automation, and data\nanalytics further advances the field and facilitates continuous improvements in hydroponic farming practices. Hydroponics is a\ngame-changer in modern agriculture, offering increased efficiency, sustainability, and productivity. Its ability to overcome the\nlimitations of traditional farming methods makes it a valuable tool for meeting the challenges of food security, environmental\nconservation, and the growing demand for nutritious and high-quality produce.\nTypes of Hydroponic Systems:\nHydroponic systems can be classified mainly into two based on the substrate used soilless-solution culture and granular-substrate\nculture Hydroponics [\n]. Types of hydroponic systems that are in use today and their\nspecification with the list of plants that grow best in them are tabulated (\nTable 1\nTable 1. Types of Hydroponic systems and specific plants.\nHydroponic System\nCharacteristics\nSpecific Plants\nReference\nNutrient Film Technique (NFT)\nThe roots of plants in NFT systems are constantly bathed in a thin coating of nutrient-rich water, from which they may draw the nutrients they need. The excess liquid is collected and subjected to a recycling process\nLeafy Greens, Herbs, Strawberries\nRaddish, Cucumber\nDeep Water Culture (DWC):\nThis involves the suspension of plant roots in a nutrient solution that is continuously oxygenated through an air pump. The roots of plants that remain submerged in water can absorb more nutrients and oxygen due to their prolonged exposure to the aquatic environment. The Dutch bucket system is a well-liked deep-water hydroponic system that offers a productive and regulated environment for plant growth. Individual buckets or containers filled with an inert medium, such as perlite or coconut coir, support the plants while enabling their roots to reach a nutrient-rich solution. Due to its scalability, simplicity of use, and adaptability for various plants, this system is commonly employed in commercial Hydroponics.\nLettuce, Herbs, Leafy Greens, And Plants With Larger Root Systems Like Tomatoes, Cucumbers, And Peppers.\nDrip System:\nThe utilization of drip systems entails the direct delivery of nutrient solutions to the root zone of plants through an arrangement of tubes and drippers. The method involves dripping the solution onto the chosen growing medium, such as perlite or coco coir, and subsequently allowing it to drain back into the container for potential reuse.\nVegetables, Fruits, Herbs, And Flowering Plants.\nEbb and Flow (Flood and Drain)\nThis involves the cyclic submersion of plants in a nutrient solution, followed by subsequent drainage back into a reservoir. The regular repetition of this cycle facilitates the provision of nutrients and oxygen to the roots.\nTomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, Strawberries. Lettuce.\nSpinach.\nRadishes.\nBeans.\nAeroponic\nThis involves the suspension of plant roots in the air, with intermittent nutrient solution application as a fine mist or spray to the roots. The observed phenomenon enables a higher level of oxygenation and nutrient uptake.\nLeafy Greens, Herbs, Strawberries\nCapsicum,\nCauliflower,\nChilli\nWick System\nPassive hydroponic setups known as wick systems are characterized by their simplicity. In this experimental setup, the plants are situated within an inert growing medium, and a wick composed of a cotton rope is employed to facilitate the upward movement of the nutrient solution from a reservoir to the root zone.\nSmall Plants, Herbs, And Low-Nutrient-Demanding Plants\nKrakty method\nAmong the other types of hydroponic methods, this system is much easier and cheaper; it does not require electronic devices and does not need electric current to operate. The entire crop needs an initial administration of water and nutrients, making the system an effective plant production method. The static, suspended-pot method is highly efficient for minimizing water wastage.\nLeafy Greens, Herbs\nOpen in a new tab\nOverview on Recent developments in Hydroponics:\nInnovative technologies, including smart home technology (domotics), IoT automated growing techniques, and AI-based systems, have\nincreasingly entered the mainstream recently and, to add to that, have relevant applications in indoor hydroponic productions\n]. The amount and accessibility of knowledge\non the web means that increasing numbers of individuals are starting to explore these growth strategies for various motives, and both\nhydroponic and indoor cultures are growing in popularity with farmers [\nDomotics for indoor cultivation- control tools:\nIt is important to consider the concept carefully while establishing a facility for indoor production and hydroponic planting.\nSpecifically, the spot, dimension, targeted plant species, and tools required for the particular task must be considered. A hydroponic\nfarming system and an indoor conservatory must operate with various specialized gadgets. To provide the optimal climate for the growth\nof plants, we will consequently need lights with specialized ranges for horticulture, aspirators for the movement of air, humidifiers,\nfans, heat producers, etc. Thermo-hygrometers for determining both humidity and temperature, heating systems that regulate aspirators\nor cooling systems, and hygrostats to regulate humidifiers or dehumidifiers are a few control devices employed nowadays for improved\nand controlled production. However, advanced Software-based controls with programs that can handle information collected by sensors\nand regulate the operation of lights, aspirators, humidifiers, etc., through in-built applications to maintain stable every\nenvironmental condition are inadequate now.\nData Acquisition for Cultivation:\nThe effectiveness or lack thereof of the yield might be influenced by a wide range of internal and external elements, including\nconventional methods of manual monitoring and measurements, which tend to be ineffective and insufficient in various ways. In this\ntime when information is easily accessible, sustaining the authenticity of the agricultural system depends on reliable information\ngathering and dissemination. These numbers and facts are statistics compiled to provide backed-up, empirical results that might\ngreatly enhance yield quality [\n]. As a result, farming will become increasingly data-driven\nand data-enabled. Even though machines do a sizable portion of processing work, individuals will still be engaged. Innovative\neliminate the need for human intervention and labour [\n]. The technical developments brought\nabout by globalization now include innovative agriculture. More automation and machine learning in farming are anticipated to result\nfrom new technologies like the Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing that could implement data and communication processes,\nincreasing production [\n]. Large firms and companies are anticipating that massive Data in\nPeta and Zeta bytes has an enormous opportunity to generate revenue in various manners [\nThe term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes an interconnected system of objects, tools, automobiles, constructions, and other\ntechnological sensing devices, like software enabling the exchanging of data. This primarily includes Radio Frequency Identification\n(RFID), and sensors. The fusion of the natural environment with computing devices and online resources offers valuable data and\nfunctionality for improved production [\n]. In a study in 2017 to validate the effect of\nInternet of the Things on Smart Hydroponic Farming Ecosystem (HFE)\" sensors and relays were exploited efficiently. The authors\nincorporated the monitoring and regulating characteristics into their prototype design to validate variables for 27 days: temperature\nof air and water, moisture, pH level, electrical conductivity (EC), water height, flow rate and nutrient concentration. The Arduino\n2560-based information recorder was developed to gather data from five sensors on six distinct variables and store it on an SD card to\nshow system efficiency instantaneously [\n]. Kyaw et al. designed a prototype utilizing\nsensors to collect data and actuators to regulate settings to validate aquaponics (growing fish with Hydroponics). They employed\nsmartphone apps for quick systems management and cloud-based storage for their regression data assessment of fish and plant growth\nRemote cultivation:\nTypically, a remote monitoring system comprises two overarching classifications of components, namely the remote telemetry units\n(RTUs) and the master stations. In broad terms, the Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) acquire data, while the master units analyze and\nexecute commands based on the acquired information. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) operate by being configured to collect exact\ncategories of data. Every device is designed to oversee particular elements of the agricultural land and transmit a notification to\nthe central system in case of any deviation from the predetermined parameters [\nIntegration of IoT in Vertical Farming:\nVertical farming is a popular trend in Hydroponics that involves stacking multiple layers of plants in a vertical arrangement. This\nfarming method saves space, reduces water usage, and increases yields per square foot of growing area. In response to increased demand\nfor agricultural productivity, vertical farming is a new technology that aims to boost crop yield per unit of land. VF is a\ntechnically challenging and pricey crop production method that uses protected horticulture systems like glasshouses and controlled\nenvironment facilities along with numerous layers of growth surfaces and/or inclined production surfaces. As a result, VF requires a\nscientific approach that considers various elements, including lighting, crop nutrition, growing systems, energy efficiency,\nconstruction, and site selection [\n]. The Internet of Things (IoT)is used in vertical farming\nto monitor environmental conditions and collect data on individual plants. IoT systems use this information to formulate accurate\nrecommendations for the amounts of light, water, and nutrients that should be provided to each plant. An IoT device prototype for\nsmart vertical farming with LED lights, sensors, a wooden board, and a battery is presented in the International Journal for Research\nin Applied Science and Engineering Technology. The prototype is equipped with sensors such as a light-detection resistor (LDR), soil\nmoisture sensor (SMS), and LM35 temperature sensor (TMS), which together gather data on plant development and then analyze and show\nthat data in a web application for optimal efficiency [\n]. Recently, there have been reports\nof a smartphone app developed in Android Studio that allows users to regulate and track plant development in hydroponic vertical\nfarming systems. Using Internet of Things technology, sensors are used to monitor environmental and dietary factors including\ntemperature, humidity, TDS, pH, and water level. The Thing-Speak cloud platform was then used to send the data. The Tashi Home\nPindfresh system and Arduino and Raspberry Pi have been utilized as control centres [\nAeroponics Technology:\nAeroponics is an indoor horticulture technique that suspends plant roots in a nutrient-rich mist, allowing maximum oxygenation and\nnutrient uptake. This highly efficient farming method can result in faster plant growth and higher yields. According to Martin-Laurent\net al. (1999) [\n], aeroponics technology is modern, relevant, and novel. For reforestation of\ndamaged land in humid climates, it can cultivate plants in huge quantities and tree seedlings linked to soil microorganisms, such as\nAM fungi.\nAquaponics: A sustainable hydroponics approach to the circular economy:\nIt is the method of cultivating plants and animals [often fish] close to one another. Bacteria convert noxious fish wastes like\nammonia into plant-friendly nitrates and nitrites. Aquaponics relies on fish waste as its primary food supply; thus, understanding\nthis concept is essential. In turn, the plants filter the water, making it safe for the fish. This approach is beneficial since it\nhelps save money and biological resources by reducing waste [\nAI-Driven Hydroponics:\nGlenn Dbritto et al. have researched land and water conservation using an artificial intelligence system in the hydroponic\ncultivation of Tomato F1 hybrid Suhyana seed. The system provides a controlled environment where a combination of water, nutrient\nsolution, and light is autonomously supplied to the plant roots. This approach aims to optimize plant growth while minimizing water\nusage and promoting sustainable land use practices [\n]. A Deep neural network (DNN) was\nimplemented in a study by Mehra et al., to regulate the hydroponic system's efficacy parameters (environmental conditions)\n]. Sensors linked to both an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi 4 have been integrated into a\nprototype indoor IoT-based hydroponic control system for the nutrient film technique; to automatically adjust and manage the nutrient\nand pH levels in the study system [\n]. A recent study conducted by Sun Park involved the\ndevelopment and implementation of an integrated system that utilizes IoT-Edge-AI-Cloud to track environmental data in strawberry\nhydroponics to identify optimal harvest times. The monitoring system is suggested to gather, organize, and visualize data related to\nthe circumstances in which strawberries are grown. Additionally, a deep learning algorithm was utilized to classify the maturity level\nof strawberries in images. An integrated interface was employed to visualize the monitoring and analysis results, offering fundamental\ndata for strawberry cultivation. Authors demand that even if the area used for strawberry farming grows, the suggested system, which\nis based on a virtualized container and the IoT-Edge-AI-Cloud idea, may be readily scaled and flexible. The hydroponic strawberry\natmosphere was monitored for 4 months to verify the effectiveness of the monitoring system. Furthermore, the verification of the\nharvesting was decided by utilizing strawberry images obtained from Smart Berry Farm [\nFactors involved in an effective hydroponic system:\nFactors affecting seed germination and seedling establishment for hydroponics system:\nRegulated farming, specifically greenhouse food crop production, has been identified as a highly intensive form of cultivation that\ncan effectively tackle the challenges of climate change, freshwater scarcity, and the increasing demand for food. The primary concern\nin the context of seedlings pertains to the challenge of insufficient germination and emergence. Controlling the factors that\ninfluence seed germination can improve crop development and reduce production costs by enhancing seed germination and emergence\n]. Factors influencing seed germination are tabulated in\nTable 2\nTable 2. Factors affecting Seed germination.\nFactors\nEffect on Seed Germination\nTemperature:\nThe germination of seeds is dependent on specific temperature conditions. The germination of plant species is influenced by the temperature range that is most suitable for their growth. Research has shown that ensuring appropriate temperature conditions can enhance the speed and consistency of seed germination. Maintaining the appropriate temperature for specific seeds during germination in a hydroponic system is crucial to monitoring [\nLight:\nThe importance of light in the process of seed germination and early seedling development has been widely recognized in the field of plant research. It has been observed that the germination process of most seeds is triggered by exposure to light, while some seeds may require a period of darkness to initiate germination. The optimal intensity and duration of light are crucial factors in hydroponic systems. Artificial grow lights, such as LED or fluorescent lights, can provide the seedlings with the required light energy [\nWater and Moisture\nOxygen\nNutrients:\nAlthough seeds possess certain nutrients to facilitate their initial growth, further nutrients are necessary for the healthy development of seedlings. A balanced nutrient solution is required in hydroponic systems, which should contain essential macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, along with micronutrients like iron, zinc, and manganese, in appropriate concentrations. Optimal seedling growth can be supported by ensuring a proper nutrient balance and maintaining the desired pH level of the nutrient solution [\npH Level:\nThe measurement of acidity or alkalinity in a solution is commonly referred to as pH. Plants' optimal growth depends on their specific pH requirements, which vary among plant species. Maintaining an appropriate pH range within the nutrient solution is crucial for successful germination and establishment of seedlings in a hydroponic system. Research has shown that the optimal pH range for most plants is slightly acidic to neutral, with a range of approximately 5.5 to 6.5. Frequent monitoring and adjustment of the pH level in the nutrient solution is crucial in establishing an ideal growth environment for the seeds [\nSeed Quality:\nThe role of seed quality and viability is crucial in determining the success of germination. Using premium seeds from trustworthy sources enhances the probability of prosperous germination and seedling establishment. In order to maximize the germination potential of seeds, it is important to use fresh, disease-free, and properly stored seeds [\nOpen in a new tab\nEffect of support system for plant growth in a hydroponic system:\nRockwool: Rockwool has been identified as a commonly used growing medium in hydroponic systems. The material under consideration is\nproduced by melting rock and spinning it into fibres. Its notable properties include high water retention capacity and adequate\naeration. The use of Rockwool has been found to provide a stable structure for root development, which in turn promotes efficient\nnutrient uptake. The versatility and accessibility of this substance make it suitable for various plant species\n]. Coco coir: Using coco coir as a growing medium is a sustainable and eco-friendly\npractice, given that it is derived from coconut husks. The material under investigation exhibits favourable water retention\ncharacteristics and facilitates adequate aeration. The use of coco coir has been found to have a positive impact on root growth, as\nwell as creating a favourable habitat for beneficial microbial activity. The capacity to buffer nutrient solutions is a recognized\ncharacteristic of the subject, which guarantees the appropriate nutrient supply to the plants [\nPeat moss: Peat moss is a frequently utilized growth substrate in hydroponic systems. The material exhibits exceptional water-holding\nproperties and demonstrates a high capacity for moisture retention. Improper soil management can lead to compaction, which can impede\nthe growth of roots. The acidity of peat moss necessitates careful monitoring and adjustment of the nutrient solution's pH. Adding\nperlite or vermiculite is a common practice to enhance aeration in the medium [\n]. Expanded\nclay pellets: The lightweight and aerating properties of expanded clay pellets, also referred to as hydroton or clay pebbles, are\nmaking them highly interested in the hydroponics field now. Additionally, these pellets have been noted to provide effective drainage.\nThey exhibit a pH value of 7, indicating a neutral nature. Furthermore, it displays a notable resistance to degradation and does not\nundergo breakdown over extended periods. Using clay pellets is prevalent in hydroponic systems that operate through flood and drain\n(ebb and flow) mechanisms. Plant roots require stability and efficient oxygen exchange, which specific structures can facilitate. The\nwater-holding capacity of these materials is limited, which may necessitate more frequent irrigation [\nSponge: Sponges and foam cubes have been identified as common support systems utilized in aeroponic or nutrient film technique (NFT)\nhydroponic systems. Providing a stable structure for seed germination and root development is crucial to plant growth and development.\nAccording to studies, sponges exhibit notable water retention capabilities and can retain nutrient solutions near roots. They also\nfacilitate adequate aeration and prevention of waterlogging. The maintenance of sponges may necessitate meticulous observation to\navoid desiccation or excessive saturation. Biochar: Biochar production involves subjecting organic matter to high temperatures in an\noxygen-free environment, producing carbon-rich material with a porous structure. The material exhibits outstanding characteristics of\nwater retention and aeration. Research has shown that applying biochar can enhance the capacity of the root zone to retain nutrients\nand promote microbial activity. Moisture regulation is one of the benefits of this technique, which also mitigates the risk of\noverwatering. The low nutrient-holding capacity of the soil may necessitate supplementary fertilization\n]. Classification of Hydroponics based on the\nusage of substrates in the medium is listed in\nTable 3\nTable 3.

The importance of both for the nourishment and growth of plants cannot be overstated. This includes\nmacro-nutrients like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, calcium, and magnesium and micro-nutrients\nlike iron, manganese, zinc, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, copper, and nickel. Plants acquire carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen through\nnatural means, specifically from the air and water they consume, with the remainder obtained from the soil. The roots obtain nutrients\nfrom nutrient solutions or aggregate media in hydroponic systems. Research has shown that hydroponic systems are comparatively less\ntolerant than soil-based systems, and any issues related to nutrients can rapidly manifest plant symptoms. The criticality of the\nnutrient solution composition and regular monitoring of the nutrient solution and plant nutrient status is a significant aspect to\nconsider. The major salt deficiencies that a hydroponic system may encounter include nitrogen, calcium, iron, magnesium, and boron\ndeficiencies. The detrimental effects of soluble salts have been attributed to various factors, including but not limited to\nover-fertilization, suboptimal water quality, gradual accumulation of salts in the aggregate media, and inadequate drainage.\nInsufficient leaching during the process of fertigation in Hydroponics can lead to the accumulation of soluble salts in the medium due\nto water evaporation [\n]. Nutrient antagonism and interaction is a crucial parameter that\nwarrants serious consideration in the context of hydroponic systems. Research suggests that plants tend to absorb nutrients\nproportionally to their presence in the nutrient solution. The phenomenon of nutrient uptake in excess leading to a higher uptake of\none nutrient at the cost of yet another has been observed and is classified as nutrient antagonism. The nutrient levels in the\nnutrient solution may not necessarily guarantee optimal plant growth and development. Despite sufficient nutrient supply, plant\nnutrient deficiency may still occur [\n]. Some\nmajor nutrients significance has been discussed below.\nNitrogen deficiency:\nIn instances of nitrogen deficiency, the colour of leaves may change to a lighter shade of green or, in severe cases, a yellow hue.\nObservations can be made from stunted development and discolouration, specifically a slight purple tint, on the stems and undersides\nof leaves. Whereas if the feeding solution includes excessive nitrogen, roots become stunted, causing blossoming to be delayed\nBoron Deficiency:\nBoron deficits are rare and often accompany calcium shortages, mainly in the case of plant's deficit with water. Boron generally\nimproves root uptake of potassium and phosphorus and keeps plant cell walls intact and functioning [\nXin Song and colleagues studied hydroponic sugar beetroot growth and yield to determine the impact of Boron (B) depletion. Sugar\nbeetroot seedlings' SLW and root-shoot ratio increased after exposure to a Boron deficit for 14 days. Enzyme activities such as\nperoxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase have decreased due to this deficiency, whereas malonaldehyde and proline have\nincreased. Oxidative stress was caused by the accumulation of ROS in plant cells and the subsequent loss of antioxidant enzyme\nperformance. According to this research, a lack of boron can negatively impact a plant's development and structure\nMagnesium Deficiency:\nHydroponic production requires a full hydroponic nutrient solution, which includes Mg as one of the key ingredients. Mg\ninsufficiency can be made worse by nutritional inconsistencies. Magnesium (Mg) uptake can be blocked by certain ions, such as Ca and\nK. Higher levels of either Ca or K can inhibit Mg uptake; therefore, the standard goal ratio is 2:1 for Ca:Mg and 4:1 for K:Mg. Mg\ndeficiency can also be caused by a few other, less frequent factors, including a cool root zone or a stunted root system due to\nillness or waterlogging. As Mg is poorly accessible at low pH (e.g., pH less than 5), a low substrate pH can also lead to Mg\ninsufficiency [\n]. However, in their study on cormrbid conditions of Mg deficiency in mulberry\nplants, Rajesh Kumar Tewari et al., has implicated the induction of oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in these plants due to\nMg deficiency in a hydroponic condition oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in mulberry plants. They have also reported a\nsignificant decrease in H2O2 production in Mg deficit plants.\nIron Deficiency:\nAn alkaline soil growing system similar to that found in sugar beet fields was created by buffering the hydroponic medium with\nsodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to characterize iron deficiency. The study claimed that the in vivo ability for Fe3+-chelate decrease\nboosted substantially in both Fe efficient genotypes (NB1 and NB1xNB4) but less than two times in the Fe inefficient genotype (NB4).\nIt was found that the distribution and period of enhanced Fe3+-chelate decline capacity were contingent on the Fe efficiency integrity\nof individual genetic makeup [\n]. In another study, Low Fe levels influence pigment and\nmicronutrient contents of chile pepper (\nCapsicum annuum\nL.) were studied through a hydroponic system. It was found\nthat the total extractable pigments of red fruits and their surface colour remained unaffected by iron treatment. However, leaf Fe and\nFe ++ were directly proportional to iron supplement, on the other hand, indirectly proportional to copper, phosphorus, and zinc\nconcentrations in the leaf [\npH level of nutrient solution:\npH indicates the solution's acidity or alkalinity. 0-14, with 7 neutrals. Maintaining nutrition solution pH levels in the optimal\nare weakly neutralized and needs automated pH adjustment to keep the root environment between 6 and 6.5 [\n]. Even though Phosphorous\n(H2PO4 to HPO4) buffers pH, pH between 1 to 10 mM, it is harmful to plants. A circulating solution with around 0.05 mM has\nsubstantially less buffering power than the new replenishment mixture that replaces transpiration losses because plants actively\nabsorb phosphorus [\n]. Nutrients commonly employed in nutrient solutions of hydroponic growing\nsystems, their functions, and the diseases associated with their deficiency in plants are tabulated in\nTable 4\nTable 4. Nutrients commonly used in hydroponic nutrient solutions.\nNutrient\nClassification\nFunction in Plant\nMajor Source\nDeficiency Symptoms\nNitrogen (N)\nEssential for growth, leaf development, and protein synthesis\nNitrate (NO3-) and Ammonium ( NH4+)\nStunted growth, yellowing leaves\nPhosphorus (P)\nKey role in root development, energy transfer, and flower/fruit formation\nPhosphate (PO4-)\nPoor root growth, purplish leaves\nPotassium (K)\nVital for overall plant health, nutrient uptake, and disease resistance\nPotassium (K+)\nWeak stems, yellowing edges of leaves\nCalcium (Ca)\nEssential for cell wall structure and overall plant stability\nCalcium (Ca2+)\nBlossom end rot, stunted growth\nMagnesium (Mg)\nCrucial for chlorophyll production and enzyme activation\nMagnesium (Mg2+)\nYellowing between leaf veins\nSulfur ( S)\nImportant for protein synthesis and overall plant vigor\nSulfate (SO4-)\nYellowing of younger leaves\nIron (Fe)\nRequired for chlorophyll formation and enzyme functions\nIron (Fe2+ and Fe3+)\nYellowing leaves with green veins\nManganese (Mn)\nNecessary for photosynthesis and enzyme activities\nManganese (Mn2+)\nYellowing between leaf veins\nZinc (Zn)\nEssential for enzyme activation and hormone regulation\nZinc (Zn2+)\nStunted growth, malformed leaves\nCopper (Cu)\nImportant for enzyme functions and photosynthesis\nCopper (Cu2+)\nWilting, leaf discoloration\nMolybdenum (Mo)\nRequired for nitrogen fixation and enzyme activity\nMolybdate (MoO4-)\nYellowing of older leaves\nBoron (B)\nVital for cell division, pollen formation, and sugar transport\nBorate (BO3-)\nBrittle and distorted leaves\nNickel (Ni)\nPlays a role in nitrogen metabolism and enzyme function\nNickel (Ni2+)\nReduced growth, leaf deformation\nOpen in a new tab\nEffect of physical factors:\nLight:\nThe significance of light in photosynthesis cannot be overstated, as it is the primary source of energy for plants to synthesize\norganic compounds. Through this process, plants convert light energy into chemical energy, which is then utilized to support their\nmetabolic processes and promote growth. Artificial lighting systems such as LED lights can be utilized in smart Hydroponics to\nregulate light's intensity, spectrum, and duration meticulously. The optimization of light settings is a crucial factor in plant\ngrowth, as it enables growers to provide the appropriate amount and quality of light that is required for each growth stage. The\nlight requirements of plants vary depending on the species, with some requiring specific amounts of red and blue light. Light\nregulation in smart Hydroponics is crucial for providing plants with adequate energy for photosynthesis, which leads to healthy\ngrowth, strong development, and enhanced yield [\nTemperature:\nTemperature plays a significant role in plant growth and metabolic processes. In smart Hydroponics, the temperature can be\nprecisely regulated to create an ideal plant environment. Each plant species has an optimal temperature range for growth and\ndevelopment, including germination, root growth, and flowering. Maintaining the appropriate temperature range can enhance enzymatic\nactivity, nutrient uptake, and overall plant performance. Smart hydroponics systems often use sensors and automated controls to\nmonitor and adjust temperature levels, ensuring that plants are kept within their preferred temperature range [\nHumidity:\nThe term humidity pertains to the quantity of water vapour in the atmosphere. The careful management of humidity in smart\nHydroponics can lead to the creation of an optimal growing environment. The impact of high humidity levels on transpiration rates in\nplants has been studied, with findings suggesting potential benefits for certain plant species during the vegetative growth stage.\nResearch has shown that high humidity levels can lead to the development of fungal diseases. Low humidity has been found to cause\nrapid moisture loss in plants, potentially resulting in water stress. Incorporating humidifiers, dehumidifiers, or ventilation systems\nin smart hydroponics systems enables the maintenance of accurate humidity levels. The manipulation of humidity levels by growers can\nfacilitate an optimal environment for plants, fostering robust growth and mitigating the likelihood of pathogenic infections\n]. In smart Hydroponics, the ability to control and optimize physical factors gives growers\ngreater precision and flexibility in creating an ideal growing environment. By fine-tuning light, temperature, and humidity, growers\ncan mimic optimal conditions for specific plant species, growth stages, and environmental preferences. This level of control allows\nfor more efficient resource utilization, improved plant health, and, ultimately higher yields in hydroponic cultivation.\nAdvantages of hydroponic smart farming:\nIncreased Yield:\nPrecise control over environmental factors promotes optimal plant growth. Nutrient-rich solutions lead to healthier and more\nvigorous plants and higher yields than traditional soil-based cultivation methods.\nWater Efficiency:\nHydroponics uses up to 90% less water than soil-based farming.

Versatile setups accommodate various plant species-adaptability\nto different growing environments and locations. By harnessing these advantages, Hydroponics could offer a highly efficient and\nsustainable method of cultivation, enabling growers to maximize yields, optimize plant quality, and minimize environmental impact.\nFuture Goal:\nAchieving 30% food sustainability by 2030 with only 1% arable land requires careful planning, innovation, and the implementation of\nvarious strategies. Some key considerations for achieving this goal include:\nHydroponics in hospitals:\nIntegrating mobile hydroponic systems in hospitals is a potential future direction for Hydroponics. This approach is considered\ninnovative and can improve nutrition and patient care. Culturing high-value plants rich in essential nutrients, minerals, vitamins,\nand therapeutic compounds can improve the quality of meals in hospitals. This targeted nourishment may support patients' recovery and\noverall well-being. Integrating a mobile hydroponic system with vertical farming techniques can optimize cultivation in a small area,\nallowing for efficient use of space in various settings such as roof-top gardens, balconies, or dedicated indoor spaces. Implementing\nthis approach guarantees an uninterrupted provision of superior plant specimens such as herbs, leafy greens, or medicinal plants.\nUsing these plants in cooking, teas, or extracts can serve as a natural source of remedies and supplements for patients, which may aid\nin fulfilling their dietary needs. Hydroponics provides a controlled environment that enables year-round cultivation, reducing\nreliance on seasonal produce and potential supply fluctuations.\nVertical Farming and Rooftop Gardens:\ninvolves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, enabling optimal utilization of space. Establishing rooftop gardens on buildings\nThe practice of indoor agriculture:\nIt encompasses greenhouse systems, can facilitate crop production throughout the year while safeguarding crops from unfavourable\nweather conditions. The practice of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) entails meticulously regulating environmental variables,\nincluding light, temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentrations, to facilitate the most favourable conditions for plant growth.\nImplementing CEA technologies has potentially improved productivity and resource efficiency\nHigh-Yield Crop Selection:\nHydroponic system studies emphasize the importance of prioritizing high-yield crops that can provide maximum output within a\nconfined space. The prioritization of crops with shorter growth cycles, higher nutritional value, and greater demand is a crucial\naspect of agricultural research. This study aims to investigate and determine appropriate crop cultivars that are well-suited for the\nclimatic conditions of Singapore and can be cultivated effectively through hydroponic or other advanced agricultural methods.\nEfficient Resource Utilization:\nThe optimization of resource utilization can be achieved by implementing smart irrigation systems, water recycling, and nutrient\nmanagement strategies.

Research has shown that the implementation of recirculating hydroponic systems can result in a significant reduction\nin water consumption.\nAgro-technology and Automation:\nImplementing advanced agro-technology and automation can enhance productivity and decrease labour demands in the agricultural\nsector. The implementation of IoT-based systems, sensors, and data analytics are being researched to monitor and control environmental\nparameters, detect crop health issues, and optimize resource usage. Implementing automated processes, such as robotic seeding,\nharvesting, and maintenance, has the potential to address labour limitations [\n]. Sustainable Energy Sources:\nThe implementation of advanced agro-technology and automation has been shown to impact productivity and labour requirements in\nagriculture positively. Implementing IoT-based systems, sensors, and data analytics can be utilized to monitor and control\nenvironmental parameters, detect crop health issues, and optimize resource usage. Implementing automated processes, such as robotic\nseeding, harvesting, and maintenance, can potentially address labour limitations [\n]. Collaboration and Partnerships: Promoting collaboration among government agencies,\nresearch institutions, industry stakeholders, and the community is essential. Promoting knowledge sharing, research collaborations,\nand public-private partnerships is essential in driving innovation, exchanging best practices, and collectively working towards\nachieving food sustainability goals [\n]. Education and Awareness:\nThis study aims to increase public awareness and knowledge regarding food sustainability and the advantages of locally cultivated\nproduce. Research suggests that urban farming initiatives in schools, community centres, and residential areas can involve citizens\nin sustainable food production and create a sense of food security [\n].

Research\nsuggests that providing grants, subsidies, tax incentives, and streamlined regulatory processes can effectively encourage investment\nin urban agriculture. The study aims to investigate the impact of policies on fostering innovation, research, and the adoption of\nsustainable farming practices [\n]. Food Waste Management: The effective management of food waste\nis a crucial area of research that requires attention. The promotion of composting, recycling, and utilising food waste as a valuable\nresource for bioenergy or fertilizers is recommended. The reduction of food waste has the potential to alleviate the burden on\nresources and foster a more sustainable food system [\nconsidering these factors and implementing a comprehensive approach that encompasses technology, innovation, collaboration, and\nsustainable practices, locals can work towards achieving their 30% food sustainability goal by 2030, despite limited arable land\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Hydroponics holds immense promise for the future of agriculture. This innovative cultivation method offers a range\nof advantages that address the challenges faced by traditional farming practices. With its ability to maximize resource efficiency,\nenable year-round crop production, and enhance yields, Hydroponics has the potential to revolutionize the way we grow food. By\nutilizing Hydroponics, we can optimize water, nutrients, and space, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. The controlled\nenvironments of hydroponic systems allow for precise control over growing conditions, resulting in accelerated growth rates and higher\nlocally-grown produce. Moreover, Hydroponics offers a pathway to environmental sustainability by reducing soil erosion, minimizing\nchemical inputs, and integrating with eco-friendly pest control methods. It also opens up possibilities for urban agriculture,\nallowing for food production in limited spaces and bringing farming closer to urban centres. As technology advances, integrating smart\ntechnologies, automation, and data analytics with Hydroponics further enhances its potential. This integration enables real-time\nmonitoring, precise control, and automation of various processes, leading to greater efficiency, reduced labour requirements, and\nimprove overall productivity.\nEdited by P Kangueane\nCitation:\nRajaseger\net al.\nBioinformation 19(9):925-938(2023)\nDeclaration on Publication Ethics:\nThe author's state that they adhere with COPE guidelines on publishing ethics as described elsewhere at https://publicationethics.org/.\nThe authors also undertake that they are not associated with any other third party (governmental or non-governmental agencies) linking with any form of unethical issues connecting to this publication.

Despite the fact that ayurvedic medicines are based on natural herbal materials, their safety depends on their method of administration, taking into account individuals’ needs and their specific disease conditions.\nKeywords:\nayurvedic polyherbal medicine, action of ayurvedic plants, importance of ayurvedic plants, ayurvedic pharmacology\nTraditional Indian medicine (or ayurveda) is becoming increasingly popular in Europe, with many chronic conditions responding to it well. While conventional medicine dominates many fields in this market, it does not always outperform traditional ayurvedic approaches. Conventional medicine frequently relies on lifelong medication, on which patients come to depend. Many medications have side-effects, and withdrawal symptoms that, if the medications are later discontinued, can become problematic. In such circumstances, ayurveda has much to offer. Patients generally respond well to ayurvedic treatments, experiencing a reduction, and sometimes even a cessation, of their symptoms. Most patients begin to take conventional medications as soon as their diagnoses are made, so ayurvedic treatments are usually undergone alongside and/or after conventional medical approaches. Patients therefore tend to experience ayurveda once their conditions have progressed. Despite this, much can be done to minimize conditions’ symptoms and control their progress. Ayurveda can help improve patients’ symptoms by reducing their cortisone and analgesic usage, thereby enhancing their quality of life.\nConcepts Underpinning Ayurvedic Medicine\nTraditional Indian medicine, or ayurveda, is based on a traditional medical system, in the same way as traditional Chinese medicine, with both being developed in their respective geographic regions. Ayurvedic practice is around 3000 years old, with a long history of managing disease. The 3 basic principles, called\ndoshas\n), are derived from 5 elements of Indian philosophy. Ayurveda’s\ndoshas\ncan be identified as regulatory control factors for fundamental physiologic processes in living systems that maintain their identity throughout biologic history:\nand its\nsubdoshas\nregulating input/output processes and motion;\nand its\nsubdoshas\nregulating throughput, turnover, and hence energy; and\nand its\nsubdoshas\nregulating storage, structure, and lubrication.\nFactors such as food, activity, the climate and stress can, however, disrupt or destroy these functions. Ayurveda seeks to normalize body functions with varied techniques including advice on food and activity, internal herbal preparations, purification treatments (\npanchakarma\n), and surgical methods (\nshalya chikitsa\nOral administration routes play a major role in influencing individuals’\ndoshas\n, via the ingestion of food, spices, and medicinal plants. These elements are influencing\ndoshas\nin different ways: stabilizing, disturbing, and supporting the body’s healthy state. A detailed knowledge of the action of food, spices, and medicinal plants is needed in order in to understand their potential influence fully.\nAyurvedic Medicinal Plants\nAyurveda first seeks to diagnose patients’ conditions before treating them with internal preparations, diet, and habit restrictions. Plant-based preparations play a major role in the ayurvedic healing process. In broad terms, there is no substance in the world that cannot be used as a potential medicine.\nTraditional ayurvedic texts warn against the use of substances that are not adequately understood.\nAny plant, animal, or mineral substance can be incorporated into the ayurvedic pharmacopeia, but only if it is understood fully, in terms of its nomenclature, identity, properties, and applications.\nThe texts also warn against the abuse of well-known medicines, emphasizing the point that even poisons can have medicinal properties when used appropriately, whereas the best of medicines can be harmful if improperly used.\nOf nearly 10 000 plants used for medicinal purposes in the Indian subcontinent, only 1200 to 1500 have been incorporated into the official ayurvedic pharmacopeia in more than 3000 years. All plants must be studied thoroughly before becoming part of the ayurvedic pharmacopeia.\nActions of Foods, Spices, and Medicinal Plants\nThe Role of Food\nFood plays a major role in ayurvedic practice by supporting the body’s healing processes. Metabolic diseases and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are directly influenced by food. Food can also indirectly affect diseases of the skin, muscles, and joints, as well as neurological, gynecological, and psychological disease.\nInfrequent consumption is unlikely to cause a problem, but frequent consumption of inappropriate foods will cause disease or worsen existing disease. Advice on food depends not only on the disease but also on the disease condition and the\ninvolved. Because of this, food advice may change throughout the course of a disease, depending on the stage reached. Interactions between foods and medicines are a major issue. The advice given with regard to food must take account of the medicines prescribed, otherwise potential interactions may worsen patients’ conditions.\nThe Action of Indian Spices\nThe second strongest influence on patients’\ndoshas\n, after food, is spices. Many spices are strong by nature. Spices are obtained from the roots, flowers, fruits, seeds, or bark of plants or herbs. Spices are native to warm, tropical climates. Coming from woody or herbaceous plants, spices have a different active principle, which gives them specific characters. These active principles have specific functions within the body. The phytochemicals within spices are secondary metabolites, which serve to protect the plants from damage by insects, animals, fungi, pathogens, and parasites. Before consumption, most spices are dried to degrade these chemicals. Drying also increases the resulting spices’ shelf life and potency.\nThe action of spices within the body differs according to the ways that they are used. Spices are mostly used for their natural flavor and aroma in processing food. In addition to adding taste, some spices (cumin, ginger, coriander) also have preventative effects, aiding digestion through the production of digestive enzymes. When mixed with digestive juices, these substances aid absorption. Such spices have individual effects, their actions depending on the constitution of the person concerned and their disease. Indian food is becoming increasingly popular and is often seen as healthy. From an ayurvedic perspective, healthy food is food that is used in a healthy way. From this viewpoint, spicy and pungent foods are not necessarily “good” foods. Indian food is not automatically ayurvedic, because the latter insists that individual’s health situation be taken into account. People with gastric hyperacidity or gastric or intestinal inflammation may find their health worsened by exposure to some Indian spices.\nAyurvedic Medicinal Plants\nApproximately 90% of ayurvedic preparations are plant based. Ayurvedic plants have a stronger action on the body than either food or spices. Such actions enable the plant to reverse pathophysiological processes and stabilize the\ndoshas\n. For this reason, one should use such plants with caution. Classical ayurvedic preparations, made from such plants, are known as “yoga” in Sanskrit. Yogas have developed following years’ of practical experience combining plants to get the optimal effect.\nPolyherbal combinations have also proven lastingly effective than single herbs. In ayurveda, most of the classical preparations are polyherbal, with a combination of 3 to 30 plants involved. These constituents are combined accurately, in such a way that the formula is balanced and reproducible. One or two of the plants in these combinations will be active and the others will play a supporting role. The supporting herbs will each have different actions, acting as catalysts to help proper absorption, transportation, and to reduce toxicity. If an ideal combination is delivered, then the result can be excellent, but such outcomes are based on thorough plant knowledge (see\nFigure 1\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nConcept of the increasingly intense influence of food, spices, and medicinal plants on the body.\nAyurvedic Plants: Misuse and Self-Medication\nWhile societal use of ayurvedic plants and Indian spices is commonplace, without ill effect, the use of more concentrated products made from single plants, often in the form of teas or tablets, is of more concern. Ayurvedic plants are generally seen as safe and free from side effects, which is not always true.\nTable 1\nlists some undesirable effects of improper use of ayurvedic herbs. Some of the common plants sold in the market are\nFigure 2\nguduchi\nFigure 3\n), and\npippali\nFigure 4\nTable 1.\nEffects and Side Effects of Commonly Propagated Ayurvedic Herbs in the Market.\nHerbs/Plants\nAyurvedic Perspective\nResults of Improper Usage\nCurcuma\n/turmeric\nAnti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic actions\nPungent and bitter in taste (\n), dry in quality (\n), hot in potency (\nveerya\n), and pungent in its postdigestive taste (\nvipaka\n).

Most owe their flavoring properties to volatile oils, and some to fixed oils and small amount of resin, known as oleoresins. Spices’ flavor is due to a blend of compounds, including alcohols, phenols, esters, terpenes, organic acids, resins, alkaloids, and sulfur-containing compounds, in various proportions.\nIn addition to these flavoring components, each spice contains components such as proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, minerals, tannins, and polyphenols. Some of the phytochemicals in commonly used spices are toxic to humans, unless the spices concerned are first dried under shade or sun. Drying serves to evaporate volatile phytochemicals.\nTurmeric should not be used in raw form, for this reason. It has been found to control a variety of agricultural and animal pests—its bioactive constituents interfering with insect behavior and growth.

From an ayurvedic perspective, diseases certainly seem to arise from the improper function of these 3\ndoshas\n. Ancient texts list 80\ndiseases, 40\ndiseases, and 20\ndiseases. The more recent recognition of new diseases should make this number even higher. The complex pathophysiology of modern disease means that the symptoms that individuals experience are always a combination of 2 or 3\ndoshas\n. This complexity means that ayurvedic preparations must be equally complex. In the classics, 63 major combinations of\ndoshas\nhave been listed and this complexity needs to be considered to elicit therapeutic effects. For example, migraine, low back pain, or arthritis of the knee can occur from\nimbalance. These diseases have different pathophysiological mechanisms, manifesting themselves in different body regions. To treat these conditions, drugs that act on the selected region are chosen. Compounds made from groups of plants are then combined in prescribed ways to achieve the desired effects. This means that undifferentiated concepts of\n-, and\n-related teas are nonsensical. Most of the above-mentioned teas contain a variety of nonspecific, commonly used, spices. While these teas can certainly be consumed for refreshment purposes, they will not cure disease.\nThe Rationale for Ayurvedic Formulations and Actions\nAyurvedic products are mainly composed of herbal combinations.\nIn certain parts of India, ayurvedic formulations also contain heavy metals. Traditional texts such as\nCharaka Samhitha\nSusrutha Samhitha\nAshtanga Samgraha\ndo not describe the use of heavy metals—clearly this is a later development. Heavy metals are toxic and are not permitted at any level in modern pharmaceuticals. By contrast, in ayurvedic preparations, metals may be added for their perceived therapeutic effects to form\nrasausadhies\n(herbo-bio-mineral metallic preparations). In ayurveda, the use of metals and minerals as medicines have been recommended only after purification (\nshodhana\n) and that with recommended low dose, with specific vehicle (\nanupana\n), for a particular period and obeying dos and donts in relation to diet, activities, and environment. Ayurveda has also described the toxic effect, complications, and diseases caused due to ingestion of raw or improperly processed metallic preparations. Researches have revealed the metal content in a number of ayurvedic\nrasausadhies\nand toxicity cases due to ayurvedic herbal consumptions have been reported throughout the last decade, especially those sold through the Internet.\nSuch metals are not found in pure herbal ayurvedic preparations.\nTraditional ayurvedic texts note that quality-assured ayurvedic compounds are strong and potent enough to combat disease. The parts of the plants chosen for use are also important. Depending on the plants concerned, and the medical combinations involved, the leaves, flowers, seeds, bark, roots, or skin of the plant may be chosen. The particular combination chosen results from extensive practical experience of the constituents needed to achieve the maximal effect. The mechanisms by which polyherbal drugs and their extracts act differ in many respects from the actions of single substances or synthetic drugs.\nPolyherbalism has its roots in the earliest texts of ayurveda like\nCaraka Samhita\nSusrutha Samhitha\nAshtanga Hrudaya\n, which systematizes the pharmaceutical procedures. The traditional Ayurvedic text\nSarangdhar Samhita\n, which dates from 1300 AD, highlights the concept of polyherbalism in this ancient medical system.\nMost ayurvedic formulations are polyherbal.\nWhile the active phytochemical constituents of individual plants are well established, they are usually present only in minute amounts and are, thus, insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effects.\nRecent research shows that combining plants of varying potency enhances their effect, both when compared to individual plant use and also to the sum of their individual effect. This phenomenon is known as synergy. Some pharmacological actions, from the active constituents of some herbs, have proven to be significant only when potentiated by those of other plants, but are not evident when used alone.\nTwo mechanisms have been proposed for these actions: pharmacokinetic synergy and pharmacodynamic synergy.\nThe former is based on herbs’ perceived ability to facilitate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of other herbs. The latter concerns the synergistic effect of active constituents with similar therapeutic actions targeting similar receptors or physiological systems. Most diseases are caused by a multiplicity of factors, leading to both visible and invisible symptoms. A combination of herbs may act on multiple targets at the same time to provide thorough relief.\nThere is a misconception that ayurvedic preparations, being natural, are always safe. This is untrue.\nCharaka Samhita\nnotes that ayurvedic medicines have adverse effects when prepared and/or used inappropriately.\nAyurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India sets standards of drugs/ingredients mentioned in different formulations of Ayurvedic Formulary of India. There are also 56 referral texts described under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Apart from these, there have been several other ayurvedic texts written during 1000 BC to 19th century. The numbers of medicinal plants have gradually increased from the Vedic period to modern era inducting more number of indigenous medicinal plants as well as exotic plants. The\nCharaka Samhita\nstresses the factors to be considered when selecting formulations’ constituents, including plants’ habitat, the season in which they grow, the prevailing harvesting conditions, the selected method of storage, and the chosen method of pharmaceutical processing.\nHowever, herbs are natural materials, and their constituents may vary due to differing geographical locations, climatic conditions, environmental hazards, harvesting methods, and collection protocols. Such factors make it difficult to standardize or reproduce the quality of the end product.\nPerson-to-person variation in gut micro flora and hepatic activity also play a role in systemic absorption.\nMethods of Drug Administration in Ayurveda\nDrug administration methods differ in ayurveda and conventional modern medicine. In the latter, most medications are synthetic; their administration influences the stomach and intestine. Most conventional medications are thus administered after food. Ayurveda has narrated timings of medication according to the patient’s nature, disease, and the condition of disease. Ayurvedic preparations are also administered on empty stomach. As the latter preparations are plant-based, they are slow-acting. The absorption of ayurvedic plant preparations occurs as part of normal metabolism. Ayurvedic preparations must be broken down for digestion in the gastrointestinal tract and has to get digested in the stomach and intestine, before getting into blood circulation and before reaching the target organ and bring about treatment action. For ayurvedic physicians, patients’ digestive strength is thus important. Ayurvedic preparations must undergo many digestive processes before being absorbed as part of normal metabolism. Ayurvedic physicians therefore analyze their patients’ metabolic state before treatment, as a matter of course, aiming for optimal stability and the least gastrointestinal damage.\nAyurvedic medicines exist in different formats, including decoctions, powders, pastes, fermented products, tablets, and medicinal butters (ghees). The formats used, whether liquids, pastes or tablets, are linked to preparations’ efficacy. If the format is changed, then the desired effect may be lost and potential side effects created. The parts of the plants used as ingredients are also very important. Sometimes, ayurvedic preparations are administered alongside other natural products, such as honey, salt, or milk, to get specific actions, according to the disease condition experienced. In Sanskrit, these natural products are termed\nAnupana\n. These natural products also help minimize any side effects. The timing of ayurveda preparations also varies according to the specific disease and its condition.\nConclusion\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that many factors must be considered in prescribing or taking ayurvedic medicine. Despite the fact that ayurvedic medicines are based on natural herbal materials, their safety depends on their method of administration, taking account of individuals’ needs and their specific disease conditions. The unguided consumption of ayurvedic preparations, in the mistaken belief that spices and herbs will necessarily be safe, may lead to serious health issues. A thorough awareness of these plants’ actions is needed for their safe selection and consumption.\nFootnotes\nAuthors’ Note:\nThe article was written at the office of Syal Kumar with the guidance of Prof Gustav J.

The connection between man and his search for drugs in nature dates from the far past, of which there is ample evidence from various sources: written documents, preserved monuments, and even original plant medicines. Awareness of medicinal plants usage is a result of the many years of struggles against illnesses due to which man learned to pursue drugs in barks, seeds, fruit bodies, and other parts of the plants. Contemporary science has acknowledged their active action, and it has included in modern pharmacotherapy a range of drugs of plant origin, known by ancient civilizations and used throughout the millennia. The knowledge of the development of ideas related to the usage of medicinal plants as well as the evolution of awareness has increased the ability of pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges that have emerged with the spreading of professional services in facilitation of man's life.\nKeywords:\nHistory, medicinal plants, plant drugs, usage\nINTRODUCTION\nEver since ancient times, in search for rescue for their disease, the people looked for drugs in nature. The beginnings of the medicinal plants’ use were instinctive, as is the case with animals.[\n] In view of the fact that at the time there was not sufficient information either concerning the reasons for the illnesses or concerning which plant and how it could be utilized as a cure, everything was based on experience. In time, the reasons for the usage of specific medicinal plants for treatment of certain diseases were being discovered; thus, the medicinal plants’ usage gradually abandoned the empiric framework and became founded on explicatory facts. Until the advent of iatrochemistry in 16th century, plants had been the source of treatment and prophylaxis.[\n] Nonetheless, the decreasing efficacy of synthetic drugs and the increasing contraindications of their usage make the usage of natural drugs topical again.\nHISTORICAL SOURCES RELEVANT FOR STUDY OF MEDICINAL PLANTS’ USE\nThe oldest written evidence of medicinal plants’ usage for preparation of drugs has been found on a Sumerian clay slab from Nagpur, approximately 5000 years old. It comprised 12 recipes for drug preparation referring to over 250 various plants, some of them alkaloid such as poppy, henbane, and mandrake.[\nThe Chinese book on roots and grasses “Pen T’Sao,” written by Emperor Shen Nung circa 2500 BC, treats 365 drugs (dried parts of medicinal plants), many of which are used even nowadays such as the following:\nRhei rhisoma\n, camphor,\nTheae folium, Podophyllum\n, the great yellow gentian, ginseng, jimson weed, cinnamon bark, and ephedra.[\nThe Indian holy books Vedas mention treatment with plants, which are abundant in that country. Numerous spice plants used even today originate from India: nutmeg, pepper, clove, etc.[\nThe Ebers Papyrus, written circa 1550 BC, represents a collection of 800 proscriptions referring to 700 plant species and drugs used for therapy such as pomegranate, castor oil plant, aloe, senna, garlic, onion, fig, willow, coriander, juniper, common centaury, etc.[\nAccording to data from the Bible and the holy Jewish book the Talmud, during various rituals accompanying a treatment, aromatic plants were utilized such as myrtle and incense.[\nIn Homer's epics The Iliad and The Odysseys, created circa 800 BC, 63 plant species from the Minoan, Mycenaean, and Egyptian Assyrian pharmacotherapy were referred to. Some of them were given the names after mythological characters from these epics; for instance, Elecampane (\nInula helenium\nL. Asteraceae) was named in honor of Elena, who was the centre of the Trojan War. As regards the plants from the genus\nArtemisia\n, which were believed to restore strength and protect health, their name was derived from the Greek word\nartemis\n, meaning “healthy.”[\n] Herodotus (500 BC) referred to castor oil plant, Orpheus to the fragrant hellebore and garlic, and Pythagoras to the sea onion (\nScilla maritima\n), mustard, and cabbage. The works of Hippocrates (459–370 BC) contain 300 medicinal plants classified by physiological action: Wormwood and common centaury (\nCentaurium umbellatum Gilib\n) were applied against fever; garlic against intestine parasites; opium, henbane, deadly nightshade, and mandrake were used as narcotics; fragrant hellebore and haselwort as emetics; sea onion, celery, parsley, asparagus, and garlic as diuretics; oak and pomegranate as adstringents.[\nTheophrast (371-287 BC) founded botanical science with his books “De Causis Plantarium”— Plant Etiology and “De Historia Plantarium”—Plant History. In the books, he generated a classification of more than 500 medicinal plants known at the time.[\n] Among others, he referred to cinnamon, iris rhizome, false hellebore, mint, pomegranate, cardamom, fragrant hellebore, monkshood, and so forth. In the description of the plant toxic action, Theophrast underscored the important feature for humans to become accustomed to them by a gradual increase of the doses. Owing to his consideration of the said topics, he gained the epithet of “the father of botany,” given that he has great merits for the classification and description of medicinal plants.[\nIn his work “\nDe re medica\n” the renowned medical writer Celsus (25 BC–50 AD) quoted approximately 250 medicinal plants such as aloe, henbane, flax, poppy, pepper, cinnamon, the star gentian, cardamom, false hellebore, etc.[\nIn ancient history, the most prominent writer on plant drugs was Dioscorides, “the father of pharmacognosy,” who, as a military physician and pharmacognosist of Nero's Army, studied medicinal plants wherever he travelled with the Roman Army. Circa 77 AD he wrote the work “De Materia Medica.” This classical work of ancient history, translated many times, offers plenty of data on the medicinal plants constituting the basic\nmateria medica\nuntil the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.[\n] Of the total of 944 drugs described, 657 are of plant origin, with descriptions of the outward appearance, locality, mode of collection, making of the medicinal preparations, and their therapeutic effect. In addition to the plant description, the names in other languages coupled with the localities where they occur or are grown are provided. The plants having mild effect are dominant, but there are also references to those containing alkaloid or other matter with strong effect (fragrant hellebore, false hellebore, poppy, buttercup, jimson weed, henbane, deadly nightshade).[\n] Dioscorides’ most appreciated domestic plants are as follows: willow, camomile, garlic, onion, marsh mallow, ivy, nettle, sage, common centaury, coriander, parsley, sea onion, and false hellebore). Camomile (\nMatricaria recucita\nL.), known under the name Chamaemelon, is used as an antiphlogistic to cure wounds, stings, burns, and ulcers, then for cleansing and rinsing the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Owing to its mild carminative action, it is particularly appropriate for usage with children. Dioscorides deemed that it had abortive action, on which he wrote, “The flower, root, and the entire plant accelerate menstruation, the release of the embryo, and the discharge of urine and stone, provided that they are used in the form of an infusion and baths.” This untrue belief was later embraced by both the Romans and the Arabs; hence the Latin name\nMatricaria\n, derived from two words:\ndenoting “mother,” i.e. matrix, denoting ‘uterus’. Dioscorides differentiated between a number of species from the genus\nMentha\n, which were grown and used to relieve headache and stomach ache. The bulbs of sea onion and parsley were utilized as diuretics, oak bark was used for gynaecological purposes, while white willow was used as an antipyretic. As maintained by Dioscorides,\nScillae bulbus\nwas also applied as an expectorant, cardiac stimulant, and antihydrotic.[\n] It is worth underscoring that Dioscorides pointed to the possibility of forgery of drugs, both the domestic ones such as opium forged by a yellow poppy (\nGlaucium flavum\n) milk sap and poppy, and the more expensive oriental drugs, transported by the Arab merchants from the Far East, such as iris, calamus, caradmomum, incense, etc.[\nPliny the Elder (23 AD-79), a contemporary of Dioscorides, who travelled throughout Germany and Spain, wrote about approximately 1000 medicinal plants in his book “Historia naturalis.” Pliny's and Dioscorides’ works incorporated all knowledge of medicinal plants at the time.[\nThe most distinguished Roman physician (concurrently a pharmacist), Galen (131 AD–200), compiled the first list of drugs with similar or identical action (parallel drugs), which are interchangeable—“De succedanus.” From today's point of view, some of the proposed substitutes do not correspond in a pharmacological context and are absolutely unacceptable. Galen also introduced several new plant drugs in therapy that Dioscorides had not described, for instance,\nUvae ursi folium\n, used as an uroantiseptic and a mild diuretic even in this day and age.\nIn the seventh century AD the Slavic people used\nRosmarinus officinalis, Ocimum basilicum, Iris germanica\nMentha viridis\nin cosmetics,\nAlium sativum\nas a remedy and\nVeratrum album, Cucumis sativus, Urtica dioica, Achilea millefolium, Artemisia maritime\nLavandula officinalis, Sambuci flos\nagainst several injurios insects, i.e. louses, fleas, moths, mosquitos, and spiders and\nAconitum napellus\nas a poison in hunting.[\nIn the Middle Ages, the skills of healing, cultivation of medicinal plants, and preparation of drugs moved to monasteries. Therapy was based on 16 medicinal plants, which the physicians-monks commonly grew within the monasteries as follows: sage, anise, mint, Greek seed, savory, tansy, etc.\nCharles the Great (742 AD–814), the founder of the reputed medical school in Salerno, in his “Capitularies” ordered which medicinal plants were to be grown on the state-owned lands. Around 100 different plants were quoted, which have been used till present days such as sage, sea onion, iris, mint, common centaury, poppy, marsh mallow, etc. The great emperor especially appreciated the sage (\nSalvia officinalis\nL.). The Latin name of sage originates from the old Latins, who called it a salvation plant (\nsalvare\nmeaning “save, cure”). Even today sage is a mandatory plant in all Catholic monasteries.[\nThe Arabs introduced numerous new plants in pharmacotherapy, mostly from India, a country they used to have trade relations with, whereas the majority of the plants were with real medicinal value, and they have persisted in all pharmacopoeias in the world till today. The Arabs used aloe, deadly nightshade, henbane, coffee, ginger, strychnos, saffron, curcuma, pepper, cinnamon, rheum, senna, and so forth. Certain drugs with strong action were replaced by drugs with mild action, for instance,\nSennae folium\nwas used as a mild laxative, compared to the purgatives\nHeleborus odorus\nEuphorbium\nused until then.\nThroughout the Middle Ages European physicians consulted the Arab works “De Re Medica” by John Mesue (850 AD), “Canon Medicinae” by Avicenna (980-1037), and “Liber Magnae Collectionis Simplicum Alimentorum Et Medicamentorum” by Ibn Baitar (1197-1248), in which over 1000 medicinal plants were described.[\nFor Macedonia, St Clement and St Naum of Ohrid's work are of particular significance. They referred to the Nikeian pharmacological codex dating from year 850, and transferred his extensive knowledge on medicinal plants to his disciples and via them to the masses.[\nMarco Polo's journeys (1254-1324) in tropical Asia, China, and Persia, the discovery of America (1492), and Vasco De Gama's journeys to India (1498), resulted in many medicinal plants being brought into Europe. Botanical gardens emerged all over Europe, and attempts were made for cultivation of domestic medicinal plants and of the ones imported from the old and the new world. With the discovery of America, materia medica was enriched with a large number of new medicinal plants:\nCinchona, Ipecacuanha, Cacao, Ratanhia, Lobelia, Jalapa, Podophylum, Senega, Vanilla, Mate\n, tobacco, red pepper, etc. In 17th century,\nCortex Chinae\n, yielded from quinine bark\nCinchona succirubra\nPavon, under the name countess’ powder, since the Countess of Chinchon was the first one who used it, was introduced to European medicine. Quinine bark rapidly overwhelmed England, France, and Germany despite the fact that there was many an opponent to its use among distinguished physicians—members of a range of academies.\nParacelsus (1493-1541) was one of the proponents of chemically prepared drugs out of raw plants and mineral substances; nonetheless, he was a firm believer that the collection of those substances ought to be astrologically determined. He continuously emphasized his belief in observation, and simultaneously supported the “Signatura doctrinae”—the signature doctrine. According to this belief, God designated his own sign on the healing substances, which indicated their application for certain diseases. For example, the haselwort is reminiscent of the liver; thus, it must be beneficial for liver diseases; St John's wort\nHypericum perforatum\nL. would be beneficial for treatment of wounds and stings given that the plant leaves appear as if they had been stung.\nWhile the old peoples used medicinal plants primarily as simple pharmaceutical forms—infusions, decoctions and macerations—in the Middle Ages, and in particular between 16th and 18th centuries, the demand for compound drugs was increasing. The compound drugs comprised medicinal plants along with drugs of animal and plant origin. If the drug the theriac was produced from a number of medicinal plants, rare animals, and minerals, it was highly valued and sold expensively.[\nIn 18th century, in his work\nSpecies Plantarium\n(1753), Linnaeus (1707-1788) provided a brief description and classification of the species described until then. The species were described and named without taking into consideration whether some of them had previously been described somewhere. For the naming, a polynomial system was employed where the first word denoted the genus while the remaining polynomial phrase explained other features of the plant (e.g. the willow Clusius was named\nSalix pumila angustifolia antera\n). Linnaeus altered the naming system into a binominal one. The name of each species consisted of the genus name, with an initial capital letter, and the species name, with an initial small letter.[\nEarly 19th century was a turning point in the knowledge and use of medicinal plants. The discovery, substantiation, and isolation of alkaloids from poppy (1806), ipecacuanha (1817), strychnos (1817), quinine (1820), pomegranate (1878), and other plants, then the isolation of glycosides, marked the beginning of scientific pharmacy. With the upgrading of the chemical methods, other active substances from medicinal plants were also discovered such as tannins, saponosides, etheric oils, vitamins, hormones, etc.[\nIn late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a great danger of elimination of medicinal plants from therapy. Many authors wrote that drugs obtained from them had many shortcomings due to the destructive action of enzymes, which cause fundamental changes during the process of medicinal plants drying, i.e. medicinal plants’ healing action depends on the mode of drying. In 19th century, therapeutics, alkaloids, and glycosides isolated in pure form were increasingly supplanting the drugs from which they had been isolated. Nevertheless, it was soon ascertained that although the action of pure alkaloids was faster, the action of alkaloid drugs was full and long-lasting. In early 20th century, stabilization methods for fresh medicinal plants were proposed, especially the ones with labile medicinal components. Besides, much effort was invested in study of the conditions of manufacturing and cultivation of medicinal plants.[\nOn account of chemical, physiological, and clinical studies, numerous forgotten plants and drugs obtained thereof were restored to pharmacy:\nAconitum, Punica granatum, Hyosciamus, Stramonium, Secale cornutum, Filix mas, Opium, Styrax, Colchicum, Ricinus\n, and so forth. The active components of medicinal plants are a product of the natural, most seamless laboratory. The human organism accepts the drug obtained from them best in view of the fact that man is an integral part of nature.[\n] There are scores of examples of this kind; perhaps they will instigate serious research into the old manuscripts on medicinal plants, which would not be observed out of curiosity about history but as potential sources of contemporary pharmacotherapy.\nIn present days, almost all pharmacopoeias in the world—Ph Eur 6,[\n] USP XXXI,[\n] BP 2007[\n]—proscribe plant drugs of real medicinal value. There are countries (the United Kingdom,[\n] Russia, Germany[\n]) that have separate herbal pharmacopoeias. Yet, in practice, a much higher number of unofficial drugs are always used. Their application is grounded on the experiences of popular medicine (traditional or popular medicine) or on the new scientific research and experimental results (conventional medicine). Many medicinal plants are applied through self-medication or at the recommendation of a physician or pharmacist. They are used independently or in combination with synthetic drugs (complementary medicine). For the sake of adequate and successfully applied therapy, knowledge of the precise diagnosis of the illness as well as of medicinal plants, i.e. the pharmacological effect of their components is essential. Plant drugs and phytopreparations, most commonly with defined active components, verified action and, sometimes, therapeutic efficiency, are applied as therapeutic means. In the major European producer and consumer of herbal preparations—Germany, rational phytotherapy is employed, based on applications of preparations whose efficiency depends on the applied dose and identified active components, and their efficiency has been corroborated by experimental and clinical tests. Those preparations have been manufactured from standardized plant drug extracts, and they adhere to all requirements for pharmaceutical quality of drugs.\nWith the new Law on Drugs and Medical Devices dated September 2007[\n] and enacted in the Republic of Macedonia, dry or sometimes fresh parts of medicinal plants (herbal substances) may be used for preparation of herbal drugs, herbal processed products, and traditional herbal drugs. Herbal substances may also be utilized for manufacture of homeopathic drugs, which are stipulated in the current law, too. In the Republic of Macedonia herbal preparations are dispensed without a medical prescription, as “over the counter” (OTC) preparations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSince time immemorial people have tried to find medications to alleviate pain and cure different illnesses. In every period, every successive century from the development of humankind and advanced civilizations, the healing properties of certain medicinal plants were identified, noted, and conveyed to the successive generations. The benefits of one society were passed on to another, which upgraded the old properties, discovered new ones, till present days. The continuous and perpetual people's interest in medicinal plants has brought about today's modern and sophisticated fashion of their processing and usage.\nFootnotes\nSource of Support:\nConflict of Interest:\nNone declared\nREFERENCES\nStojanoski N.

Ranked third most prevalent and seventh highest specific cause of disability worldwide (GBD 2012),[\n] migraine is currently the leading cause of Years Lived with Disability/Disease (YLD) among individuals under 50 years with a male, female ratio of 1:3.[\n] Migraine therapy involves the use of non-specific and specific drugs, and more recently, “gepants” are used for prevention and acute management.[\n] Though these conventional treatments have proved to be satisfactory, they are associated with side effects. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies are increasingly being sought after by migraineurs worldwide for prophylaxis and treatment of attacks. Acupuncture, yoga, meditation, Ayurveda, biofeedback, cognitive behavior therapy, massage therapy, and Nutraceuticals are some of the popular methods.[\n] A cross-sectional study shows among 685 patients with headaches, 478 of them were using CAM, out of which 44.4% were suffering from migraine.[\n] In another national cross-sectional survey, adults with migraine/severe headaches used CAM more often as compared to those without, i.e., 49.5% vs. 33.9%.[\nMigraine in Ayurveda\nMigraine can be correlated to “Ardhavabhedaka” in Ayurveda. Detailed description of specific etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment for Ardhavabhedaka is explained in treatises. Etiological factors such as excessive consumption of dry/ununctuous substances, exposure to cold, inappropriate sexual activity, withholding of natural urges, exhaustion, and exercise are quoted as the causes for Vata (biological humour ~ neurological function) vitiation. Frequent intake of food before the digestion of a previous meal, intake of heavy to digest food, drinking excess cold water contribute to Kapha (biological humour ~ systemic integrity) vitiation and formation of ama (a by-product of impaired metabolism). Due to the above etiological factors, Vata alone or along with Kapha affects the head and produces severe unilateral pain in the neck, eyebrow, temples, ear, eye, and forehead. Pain is acute, similar to a blow from sharp weapons, pricking, or splitting, and when severe, it impairs the functions of the eye and ear.[\n] Pain is paroxysmal, occurring once in ten days, twelve days, or daily.[\n] This phenomenon can be closely read in line with the series of events such as vasodilatation, secondary extravasation, edema, mast cell degranulation, and cortical spreading depression that is triggered by the release of neuropeptides from the trigeminal innervation in migraine. The treatment includes Snehapana (internal Oleation), Svedana (sudation), Virechana (Therapeutic Purgation), and Nasya (Nasal Instillations), followed by oral intake of Polyherbal and Herbo-mineral medications. Further symptoms of migraine often correlate with those of ‘Amlapitta’ (state of hyperacidity) characterized by giddiness, fainting, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Hence, therapies that aid in hyperacidity and correction of digestive fire also aid in improving migraine symptoms.[\nMaterials & Methods\nA thorough literature search was conducted in three electronic databases (PubMed, AYUSH Research Portal, and Google Scholar) from January 2000 to July 2020. Clinical trials, pilot studies, and case reports published in the English language were included. Preclinical studies, conceptual reviews, and unpublished manuscripts were excluded. The keywords used in PubMed were “Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Migraine”, “Ayurveda and Migraine”, “Panchakarma and Migraine”. Sixty-two articles were obtained, out of which one pilot study and three clinical trials were shortlisted. The filters used in AYUSH Research Portal were (a) Medical system: Ayurveda, (b) Category: Clinical research, followed by (c) Body system: Neurological, and (d) Disease: Migraine, yielding seventeen articles graded A, B, and C, based on the WHO recommendations. Under Grade A, there were no articles, Grade B had five papers, and Grade C had twelve articles. Two of these studies were found in PubMed. After screening through the title, abstract, and year of publication, eight articles were found to meet our criteria. Finally, twelve eligible articles were shortlisted, i.e., eleven clinical trials and one pilot study. The details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the articles shortlisted from various sources are depicted in the PRISMA flow chart [\nFigure 1\n]. The details of the studies included in this review are summarized in a table [\nTable 1\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nPRISMA flow diagram\nTable 1.\nClinical trials involving ayurveda intervention in migraine\nAuthor (year)\nStudy design and sample size\nMedicine dosage and duration\nOutcome measures\nResults\nDr.MS Vasudha, NK Manjunath, HR Nagendra (2018)\nClinical Trial\n=30 Ayurveda and Yoga (AY)\n=30 (Control group)\nVirechana comprising -\n1) Deepana - with Hinguvachadi churnam-2.5 to 5g Duration: 3 days\n2) Snehapana with Kalyanaka ghrta (30 ml-150 ml), duration - 3 to 5 days.\n3) Abhyanga and sveda\n4) Virechana with Trivrt lehyam Oral Medication -\n5) Pathyaksha dhatryadi Kashaya -15 ml bd for 75 days.\n6) Thalam with Kachooradi churna and milk\n7) Yoga\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 10)\nSignificant reduction in MIDAS, PSS, and improved sympatho-vagal balance were observed in the AY group.

Eight studies used polyherbal formulations, four used Herbo-mineral formulations, and one study had a combination of both. Ten trials had employed panchakarma procedures; among them, eight studies included Nasya in the treatment protocol, and three trials included Virechana. Two studies were devoid of oral therapy, wherein Nasya alone or along with external therapies were administered. Eleven studies found Ayurveda to be clinically beneficial as monotherapy, while one study demonstrated the usefulness of Ayurveda as an add-on to conventional management. Among these, two studies incorporated an integrated approach of Ayurveda and yoga to give statistically significant results.[\n] One clinical trial has included Behavioral Toxicity and Neurological Side effect as assessed by DOTES (Dose recorded and treatment-emergent symptom scale) criteria and found minimal side effects.[\n] No side effects or adverse events were reported in any other studies.\nDiscussion\n] Ayurveda has a holistic approach, which comprehensively promotes mind-body medicine. Furthermore, Ayurveda therapies are known to influence physiological processes, including autonomic modulation and metabolic profiles.[\nShodhana (purification) and Shamana (pacifying) therapy are two limbs of Ayurveda treatment. Migraine being correlated to Ardhavabhedaka, Shodhana procedures Nasya and Virechana, and Shamana medicines in the form of medicated ghee and polyherbal decoctions have been vividly prescribed as effective interventions in the classics.[\n] Most of the studies have employed Virechana along with Nasya and Shamana medicines for better efficacy in terms of severity, frequency, and duration of the headache. In line with classical management, few trials have employed Virechana before Nasya and pacifying medicines; there was no common formulation of choice across them. But all the medications were targeted against involved dosha (Humour). Hence, discussed mainly focuses on the interventions like Nasya, Virechana, and Shamana medicines comprising different Herbal and Herbo-mineral preparations and External therapy.\nNasya is one of Bio-purificatory measures; the procedure involves the administration of medicines through the nasal route. Medicines administered through the nasal route directly deliver the medicine to the brain, thereby disseminating it to the entire body.[\n] On administration, the potency of the herbs used for nasal instillation reach\nshringataka\n(the vital point at the base of the nose), and then the potency spreads to the head, eyes, ear, and throat, and aids in expelling the morbid\ndoshas (vitiated humour)\nfrom the head. The probable mode of action may be imputed to its stimulating effect on the brain through olfactory and respiratory pathways. The nasal epithelium is a highly permeable monolayer, and the submucosa also has extensive vasculature; it promotes rapid absorption and direct entry of the drug into the systemic circulation, bypassing hepatic metabolism. Intranasal drug delivery via olfactory and respiratory pathways is a promising option to deliver medication to the central nervous system. Lipid-based drugs of lower molecular weight less than 400–600 Da (Dalton), with a positive charge, have a better capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier.[\nThere are eight studies on Nasya. Two studies are on Brhat Dashamoola taila, wherein it was compared with Laghu Sutashekhara rasa (LSR), go-ghrta, and placebo. Four sittings of Nasya for one week with a gap of one week were administered. Although significant improvement was found in severity and frequency of headache, the LSR group fared better than the other three groups.[\n] In another study, LSR alone was more efficacious than LSR and three sittings of Brhat Dashamoola taila nasya with a gap of one week in reducing the severity, frequency, and duration of headaches as well as associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and aura.[\n] In a study on Gunja taila shodhana nasya (eliminating nasal instillation), Nasya was administered after following pre and post-therapeutic measures as per treatise. Significant improvements with delayed response were noticed in the frequency of headache, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, and anorexia. But when administered with Pathyadi Ghana Vati, the clinical response was faster and more beneficial.[\n] A study on Kumkumadi Ghrita was significant in ameliorating symptoms related to migraine headache compared to Dashamoolashrtaksheera Shirodhara (dipping of milk boiled medicated herbs on forehead). Yet the therapies Nasya and Shirodhara, in combination, had greater potential in the management of the same.[\nIn another study, Brhat Jeevakadi taila nasya showed better results in symptoms associated with migraine headache, including severity and frequency, compared to Flunarizine 10 mg, wherein it fared better only in reducing the associated vomiting.[\n] In another study, Panchagavya Ghrta nasya along with Tab. Flunarizine 10 mg scored better on pain scales. A lower proportion of patients had Behavioural Toxicity and Neurological Side effects as compared to the Flunarizine-placebo and Flunarizine-only groups.[\n] A study on Shatahvadi taila showed significant improvement in migraine severity, frequency, and duration of attack.[\n] Anutaila nasya, every alternate day for fourteen days, showed good relief in 70% of cases in comparison to 60% of subjects with Kaphaketu rasa. Better results were obtained when both medicines were combined, and poor results were observed in 10% of subjects that received Anutaila nasya.[\nVirechana\nVirechana is one of the Bio-purificatory measures. Virechana drains the cellular fluid into the interstitial fluid. Later, the fluid moves into the vascular compartment, which is further drained into the Gastrointestinal tract for expulsion. Thus, the process creates a biochemical alteration as it modulates the fluid compartments of the body. The fluid which gets drained out contains dissolved biochemicals.[\n] Oral medications administered after bio-purificatory measures exert better efficacy owing to improved metabolic status. The procedure includes measures that augment digestive fire followed by oral intake of medicated fats, therapeutic massage, sudation, and finally induced purgation. In the present review, Virechana was carried out in three studies. Vasudha MS\n. administered Trivrt Lehya for virechana, while Shweta Mata\n] chose Triphala churna for mridu (mild) virechana for three days.\nShamanaoushadhi (pacifying medications)\nPathyadi Khada (Polyherbal decoction) is commonly prescribed for migraine.[\n] It was effective in two controlled clinical trials and one pilot study.[\n] In an RCT, Pathyadi Khada was administered in the form of a tablet, i.e., Pathyadi Ghanavati[\n] was effective in improving the severity, frequency, and duration of headaches measured on MIDAS and CHQQ (Comprehensive-Headache Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire). Further, sympathovagal balance and reduced frontalis muscle activity were recorded with its use in combination with yoga. The ingredients of Pathyadi Khada possess anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory properties, and are neuroprotective.[\n] Additionally, Pathya (Terminalia chebula Retz.) has analgesic properties.[\n] Mashadi kashaya and Nimbadi Guggulu were administered in a single group of migraineurs along with Shatahvadi taila nasya. The overall assessment showed complete relief in eighteen patients and marked relief in twelve patients.[\nHerbo-mineral medications\nFive clinical trials utilized Herbo-mineral preparations in their study. Ayurveda Treatment Protocol (AyTP) consisting of a combination of Narikela Lavana 2000 mg, Sootashekhara Rasa 375 mg, Sitopaladi Churna 1425 mg, Rasona Vati 3000 mg, and Godanti Mishran 500 mg at a dose of 7.3 g per day was administered in a large sample of 406 subjects.[\n] The combination of the AyTP safety profile of Sootashekhara Rasa, Rasona Vati, and Godanti Mishran was initially established in animal models.[\n] Seventy-two (35.2%) of the patients got completely cured, and no improvement was seen in seven (3.4%) patients. Forty-five (11%) patients discontinued the therapy due to deterioration of the condition. But there were no noticeable adverse events in the patients who completed 90 days of treatment. In another study, Sutashekhara Rasa with drakshajala (raisins-soaked water) as an adjunct was administered along with Brhat Jeevakadi taila nasya. Compared to Flunarizine, Sutashekhara Rasa, along with Nasya ameliorated most symptoms associated with migraine.[\n] Laghu Sutashekhara rasa (LSR) was administered in two studies as stand-alone and in combination with nasya.[\n] LSR as a stand-alone was found to be more effective compared to Nasya. Similarly, Kaphaketu rasa as stand-alone and along with Anutaila Nasya showed significant results.[\nExternal therapy\nAgnikarma (cautery)[\n] with Panchadhatu Shalaka (an instrument for cautery made of five metals) was carried out in a pilot study for four settings with a gap of one week, and Pathyadi Khada was administered internally. Significant improvements were seen in eleven (78.6%) patients. Studies claim probable stimulation of lateral spinothalamic tract due to heat which intern stimulates the descending pain inhibitory fibres. This, in turn, inhibits the release of Psubstance (Presynaptic inhibition) and blocks the transmission of pain sensation. Heat has also been thought to act as a counter-irritant. According to the pain-gate control theory, heat stimulates the nociceptor fibres residing in the superficial skin. These fast-acting fibres, after being stimulated, close the gate for slow-acting fibres for chronic pain.[\n] Shirodhara (dipping therapy) with Dashmoolashrita Ksheera over the forehead for 45 min/day for 21 days exerted soothing effects but was not effective compared to Kumkumadi Ghrita Nasya. But studies have shown the efficacy of Shirodhara in chronic daily headaches.[\n] Kachooradi churna application over the forehead along with purificatory and pacifying medications was effective in migraine.[\nAssessment tools\nMost of the studies employed a subjective parameter scale for the assessment of the outcome. The items of assessment include severity, frequency, and duration of headache, associated symptoms like photophobia, phonophobia, aura, nausea, and vomiting. Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire was utilized for assessment in three studies.[\n] Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for measurement of the intensity of the pain was employed in three studies.[\n] Headache Impact Test-6 and Perceived Stress Scale-10 were utilized in two studies.[\n] Clinical Global Impression rating scale to assess severity, as well as improvement after therapy (CGI, CGI-I), Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), were used in one study. Behavioral Toxicity and Neurological Side effects using DOTES criteria as well as presenting the patient-reported side effects or symptoms associated with migraine during the therapy were administered in one study.[\n] One study appreciably incorporated Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and surface Electromyography (sEMG). In this study, ten patients with migraine with aura (MA) had reduced SDNN, as well as an increased LF/HF ratio, suggesting sympathetic hyperactivity. The migraine without aura (MO) patients (\n= 17) had a similar impairment, though not as severe as in the MA group.[\n] The study outcome confirms an attenuated stress response after Ayurveda and Yoga integrated approach.[\nLimitations\nRandomization was the major limitation; even though the studies were systematically conducted and showed significant results, there was a lack of randomization. Out of twelve studies reviewed, only six studies were Randomized Control Trials. None of the studies were double-blinded, whereas few were rater blinded studies. Only one study had placebo and active control (flunarizine) in comparison to Ayurveda intervention. Most of the studies were underpowered with a small sample size to answer the research question of interest. In the Study by Trivedi M\net al.\n, though the sample size was good, uniformity across the group was not maintained. A study by Vaidya PB\n] Another major limitation of the studies was employing subjective grading of the symptoms for the assessment of the outcome. Though few studies showed significant results, the assessment scales were subjective. In the studies on Nasya, only one study had employed the pre and post-measures of Nasya therapy as per classical treatises. Apart from one study, no other studies had employed tests to assess toxicity, neurological Side effects, and patient-reported side effects or symptoms of migraine.\nScope for Further Research\nAdopting the line of treatment of Ardhavabhedaka (migraine) as per classical treatises and use of Herbo, Herbo-mineral, and various ghee-based preparations for purificatory measures and pacifying the condition in the form of RCTs with adequate sample size. Adopting standardized assessment outcome measures with the assessment of safety of the intervention and drug interactions. Incorporating advanced techniques like Blood Oxygen Level Dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI), functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), Heart Rate Variability (HRV) would aid understanding the pathophysiology, neurobiology of the intervention and would help in generating solid evidence for Ayurveda interventions.\nConclusion\nAyurveda has a holistic approach to treatment rather than symptom-specific management, be it a migraine or any other disease. Intervention from the level of etiology, pathogenesis, aggravating and relieving factors, and disease-specific management along with diet and lifestyle is vital in Ayurveda. Bio-purificatory measures like Virechana and Nasya have shown good efficacy as standialone and as an add-on with oral herbal and Herbo-mineral preparations. Though few studies have shown significant results, they are underpowered due to the small sample size, lack of control group, and randomization. Future research should target to understand the pathophysiology of migraine and the changes Ayurvedic therapies could bring in, with adequate sample size, use of validated scales, biomarkers, neuroimaging, and autonomic function tests for better understanding of the neurobiology of Ayurveda intervention.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nWe acknowledge the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), the Department of AYUSH, Government of India for funding the study.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\nGormley P, Anttila V, Winsvold BS, Palta P, Esko T, Pers TH, et al.

In addition to these established medications, herbal ingredients have been used over centuries to help treat common cold symptoms. The Ayurveda and Jamu systems of medicine, originating from India and Indonesia, respectively, have leveraged herbal therapies to treat many illnesses.\nMethod\nAn expert roundtable discussion comprising specialists in Ayurveda, Jamu, pharmacology and surgery along with a literature review was conducted to evaluate the use of four herbs – ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint – for common cold symptom management in Ayurvedic texts, Jamu publications and monographs from the World Health Organization, Health Canada and various European guidelines.\nDiscussion\nDue to a lack of antivirals, common cold management revolves around maintaining personal hygiene and symptom management. Herbal medicines have been an integral part of many cultures worldwide. Despite its growing acceptance, there is a perception that healthcare providers lack interest and may prevent patients from discussing the use of herbal medicines. Limited education and training may also widen the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers, hindering effective management.\nConclusion\nEvaluation of scientific evidence and the standing in international monographs can offer perspectives on the use of herbal medicines for common cold management.\nKeywords:\ncomplementary therapies, COVID-19, ginger, integrative medicine, liquorice, peppermint, turmeric, upper respiratory tract infections\nIntroduction\nThe common cold is a syndrome of upper respiratory symptoms caused by various viruses.\nSymptoms of the common cold include sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough, sore throat and malaise.\nThese symptoms typically last up to 1 week, with their severity peaking around the second to third day of infection.\nThe common cold imposes a substantial disease and economic burden stemming from its high frequency, with an estimate of about six episodes per year in children under 2 years of age, and two to three episodes per year in adults, as well as from its impact on quality of life.\nIn terms of economic impact, the common cold causes an estimated yearly loss of US$40 billion directly through treatment costs and indirectly via loss of productivity.\nThe common cold is generally mild and self-limiting.\nSymptoms of the common cold are so well known that self-diagnosis is normal amongst individuals.\nHowever, there are misuses of diagnosis testing and overuse of treatment prescriptions for suspected bacterial acute rhinosinusitis, which occurs at a very low incidence of less than 2% of all common colds.\nIt is also important to be aware of the distinction between bacterial and non-bacterial acute rhinosinusitis, as incorrect antibiotic use may result in more harm than benefit and the potential risk of developing resistance.\nManagement of the common cold\nDue to lack of antiviral treatments targeting specific common cold viruses, prevention and treatment of the common cold typically revolves around maintaining personal hygiene and symptom management.\nFurthermore, as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks, physical distancing, travel restrictions and avoiding crowds may limit the spread of infectious diseases like influenza.\nPatients typically manage a common cold through self-care, using a range of over-the-counter therapies like antihistamines, antitussives, decongestants and antipyretics.\nNasal irrigation is also recommended by the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) 2020 to relieve symptoms of the common cold.\nTreatments and practices that are used concurrently with or in place of the conventional, mainstream medicine – broadly termed complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) – are gaining widespread popularity and acceptance worldwide.\nAmongst CAM, the use of herbal medicines has been an integral part of many cultures worldwide.\nIt is estimated that up to four billion people rely primarily on herbal medicinal products for healthcare and medical practice.\nIn addition, EPOS 2020 recommends the use of herbal medicines for the common cold because of their efficacy in controlling symptoms without the risk of major adverse events.\nDespite its growing usage and acceptance, there is a perception that healthcare providers lack interest in CAM,\nwhich may prevent patients from exploring this option with their healthcare providers.\nLimited education and training on CAM may also widen the communication gap between patients and their healthcare providers, hindering effective patient management.\nTo overcome this barrier, physicians have acknowledged the need for a better understanding of CAM and its synergistic implementation into routine practice.\nThis review aims to provide a better understanding of the traditional and modern perspectives on some of the herbal ingredients putatively used for common cold symptom management. In particular, we will discuss in this regard the principles of two traditional systems of medicine: Ayurveda and Jamu. As herbal ingredients form the core component of these systems, we evaluate four herbs used in the treatment of common cold symptoms: ginger (\nZingiber officinale\n), liquorice (\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\n), turmeric (\nCurcuma longa\n) and peppermint (\nMenthae piperitae\n). Specifically, we will evaluate the evidence and their standing in local and international monographs for the management of the common cold and offer an overview on the future of herbal medicines in its treatment.\nMethods\nThis review was developed following an expert virtual roundtable meeting comprising five specialists in Ayurveda, Jamu, pharmacology and surgery conducted in November 2021. Literature searches were conducted using search terms including “ginger”, “licorice”, “liquorice”, “turmeric”, “peppermint”, “Ayurveda” and “Jamu”. Only results relevant to the topic of the common cold were selected. Additional references focusing specifically on Ayurvedic texts, publications on Jamu, and monographs from World Health Organization (WHO), Health Canada and various European guidelines were also selected.\nReview\nAyurveda and Jamu\nIntroduction to Ayurveda and Jamu\nAyurveda is a renowned traditional medical system originating from India.\nIt aims to provide a holistic approach to health and personalized medicine as it comprises the physical, psychological, philosophical, ethical and spiritual components of health.\nHerbal ingredients are featured prominently in Ayurveda, and approximately 90% of Ayurvedic preparations are plant based.\nIndonesia holds the second largest biodiversity in the world after the Amazon rainforests.\nIndeed, of the medicinal plant species in Southeast Asia, nearly 80% can be found in Indonesia.\nWith this rich source of medicinal plants, people from Indonesia widely use a traditional herbal medicine system called Jamu.\nDespite the increasing importance of modern conventional medicine, Jamu remains widely used across rural and urban areas of Indonesia by an estimated two-fifths of the population.\nAyurveda principles for the common cold\nThe basic principles of Ayurveda lie in the belief that the entire universe is composed of five elements: Prithvi (Earth), Jala (Water), Teja (Fire), Vayu (Air) and Aakash (Space or ether).\nThese five elements, referred to as Pancha Mahabhoota, are believed to form the three fundamental humours (tridoshas) of the human body in varying combinations.\nThese three humours are Vata dosha, Pitta dosha and Kapha dosha, which control the fundamental functions of the body.\nVata dosha regulates electrolyte balance, cellular transport and elimination of waste products.\nPitta dosha regulates thermogenesis, optic nerve coordination, and satiety and thirst.\nLastly, Kapha dosha provides lubrication to the joints.\nAs the strength of each dosha is affected by conditions of the body and food consumed, Ayurveda is based on the belief that balance between the three doshas and other elements of nature is necessary to maintain a healthy body.\nThe manifestation of a communicable viral infection can happen due to unstable air (Vayu), water (Jala), soil (Desha) and season (Kala) elements.\nThe initial stages of a viral infection, such as an upper respiratory tract infection like the common cold, starts off as an exogenous disease (Agantu Roga), which later progresses into a system disease (Nija Roga).\nIt can arise due to slow digestion (Mandagni) and lead to the production of toxins (Ama) in the body. As the bodily Ama accumulates, it blocks the channels of the body\nand eventually enters the deep tissues to clog the cell membranes, inhibits cellular communication and weakens the immune response.\nThe resulting disruption of the body doshas is described in Ayurvedic texts as the pathogenesis of salient common cold symptoms. For instance, the manifestation of cough (Kāsa) is explained by the obstruction of the Vata dosha afflicting the upward movement of air (Vayu), leading to a build-up in the head and neck region.\nThe contraction of the thorax and eyes is followed by a forced expulsion of air, giving rise to cough, which can be either dry or productive.\nRhinitis (Pratishyaya) is regarded in Ayurveda as one of the most important nasal diseases (Nasa Roga) as it is assumed to be the causative factor for other nasal diseases.\nAyurveda describes rhinitis as a condition where impairment of Vata dosha and Kapha dosha at the root of the nose produces secretions that flow down through the nose.\nThe treatment process in Ayurveda employs the Pancha Karma method,\nwhich comprises five actions or karmas that are used to remove toxins from body tissue.\nThe five karmas are Vaman (forced emesis), Virechan (purgation using powders, pastes or decoctions), Basti (enemas prepared from medicated oils), Nasya (nasal administration of medicines such as decoctions, oils and fumes) and Rakta moksha (blood detoxification).\nIndonesian traditional beliefs on the common cold\nAmongst several traditional theories surrounding the common cold is the ‘cold weather theory’, which regards cold, in the context of the absence of heat, to be responsible for the illness.\nIn Indonesia, this belief takes the form of the concept known as Masuk Angin, or literally, trapped wind.\nThe symptoms of Masuk Angin include headache, nausea, fever, mild fatigue, vomiting and diarrhoea.\nThe concept of Masuk Angin in Indonesia may be related to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) belief that natural forces, including the wind, can disrupt bodily balance, leading to illness.\nIn TCM, the wind is considered to manifest in the highest and the outer parts of the body such as the face, skin, sweat glands and lungs.\nWhen classifying different types of infectious diseases, wind is the medium for transmission and can be ‘passed from one to another’. Invasion of the wind weakens the body’s immune defensive capabilities and causes a mismatch in the opening and closing of the pores.\nThis leads to the invasion of pathogens and, ultimately, to development of the common cold.\nThere are several traditional Indonesian treatments for Masuk Angin.\nJamu shares many aspects with TCM such as treating ‘hot’ illnesses with ‘cold’ remedies.\nThere are also other widely used traditional therapies, such as cupping and skin scraping (\nkerokan\n), which aim to remove the trapped wind through the skin surface.\nThese therapies, along with Jamu, operate with the principle of removing excess wind to regain balance within the body, similar to the concept of removing excess congestion in modern medicine.\nHerbal medicines for the common cold – Ayurveda and Jamu\nAs outlined above, herbal ingredients form the core component of both Ayurvedic and Jamu systems.\nFour herbs – ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint – have been extensively used for the management of common cold symptoms in both Ayurveda and Jamu for thousands of years. Furthermore, regardless of the therapeutic systems and geographic differences, their pharmacological properties have now been confirmed through clinical evidence. Additionally, the following section will survey the use of these herbal ingredients in Ayurveda and Jamu and evaluate their standing in local and international monographs. The usage of herbs based on various therapeutic systems and their pharmacology is summarized in\nTable 1\nTable 1.\nUsage of herbs based on various therapeutic systems and their pharmacology.\nAyurveda\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nPharmacology\nGinger\nZingiber officinale\n(Śun.t.hī, Ārdraka)\nProperties:\nAntitussive (Kaphahara)\nCardioprotective (Hridya)\nAppetite stimulating (Dipana)\nTreatment for:\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Śvāsa)\nPain (Śūla)\nConstipation (Vibandha)\nFlatulence (Ānāha)\nInflammation (Śopha)\nNeck disorders (Kan.tharoga)\nTreatment for:\nHeadache\nNausea\nVomiting\nInfluenza\nVertigo\nPreventive medicine for nausea and vomiting and an adjunct treatment for inflammatory diseases\nTreatment for cold and flu symptoms\nAs expectorant and antitussive to relieve symptoms of bronchitis, cough and colds\nAnti-inflammatory activity\nShogaol and ginger extracts inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities\nLiquorice\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\n(Yas.t.ī)\nProperties:\nStrength (Balya)\nPurifies blood (Vatapittajit)\nTreatment for:\nCough (Kāsa)\nPulmonary tuberculosis (Ks.aya)\nHoarseness (Svarabheda)\nOphthalmological disorders (Chakshuksha)\nTreatment for:\nRheumatic diseases\nCough with phlegm\nDemulcent for sore throat, expectorant for cough and bronchial build-up\nAs expectorant to relieve chest complaints including catarrhs, cough and bronchitis\nAntitussive activity primarily attributed to glycyrrhizin, which accelerates tracheal mucus secretion\nAnti-inflammatory activity is attributed to corticosteroid-like activity of glycyrrhizin\nTurmeric\nCurcuma longa\n(Haridrā)\nProperties:\nAnthelmintic (Kr.mighna)\nAntileprotic (Kus.haghna)\nSkin complexion improving (Varn.ya)\nAntidote (Vis.aghna)\nAntidiabetic (Pramehanāśaka)\nTreatment for:\nAsthma\nHypertension\nRheumatism\nTreatment of flatulence, acidity and atonic dyspepsia\nUse in pain and inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis, and treatment for asthma and cough\nAnti-inflammatory activity due to curcumin and its derivatives for its ability to scavenge oxygen radicals\nPeppermint\nMenthae piperitae\n(Satva)\nProperties:\nAppetite stimulating (Dipana)\nAntitussive (Kaphahara)\nOral hygiene improving (Mukha-śodhana)\nDigestive (Pācana)\nAnalgesic (Śulapraśamana and Vedanāsthāpana)\nTreatment for:\nChronic fever (Jīrna jvara)\nPain (Śūla)\nTreatment for:\nSore throat\nAntiseptic for oral germs\nRelieve symptoms of cough and cold, muscle pain, irritable bowel syndrome and headache\nFor treatment of fever, catarrhs and inflammation of the oral mucosa\nNasal cooling activity\nMenthol binds to TRPM8 to elicit cooling sensation\nAnalgesic activity\nMenthol causes cooling sensation on skin via TRPM8 receptor activation\nAntispasmodic activity\nPeppermint inhibits activation of calcium channels, which in turn leads to smooth muscle relaxation\nOpen in a new tab\nTRPM8, transient receptor potential melastatin.\nGinger (\nZingiber officinale\nUse in Ayurveda\nIn the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, ginger is referred to as Śun.t.hī (dried ginger) or Ārdraka (fresh ginger).\nGinger is described to have antitussive (Kaphahara), cardioprotective (Hridya) and appetite-stimulating (Dipana) properties and is traditionally used for relieving bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Śvāsa), pain (Śūla), constipation (Vibandha), flatulence (Ānāha), inflammation (Śopha) and neck disorders (Kan.tharoga).\nUse in Jamu\nGinger is used extensively in Jamu, and the National Agency of Drug and Food Control in Indonesia has classified it as a priority plant for medicinal use.\nUses of ginger in Jamu include treatment for headache, nausea and vomiting, influenza, cough, and vertigo.\nPharmacology\nExperimental studies have documented the pharmacological properties of ginger, including its anti-inflammatory properties. Shogaol and compounds from ginger extracts were shown to inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities in a dose-dependent manner.\nBoth of these enzymes are involved in the metabolism of prostaglandin E\nand leukotriene B\n, which are potent mediators of inflammation.\nAs such, one manner by which ginger exhibits anti-inflammatory properties may be due to its inhibitory effect on the production of inflammatory molecules.\nOther possible mechanisms for ginger’s anti-inflammatory activity may be via the inhibition of thromboxane synthase whilst raising prostacyclin level and inhibiting nitric oxide release.\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nGinger is used in modern medicine as a preventive medicine for nausea and vomiting and as an adjunct treatment for inflammatory diseases.\nThe anti-inflammatory property of ginger has been demonstrated in two clinical studies where injection of ginger extract and oral administration of ginger powder reported benefits in alleviating pain and swelling, respectively.\nThe use of ginger for the treatment of cold are described in the Chinese and African pharmacopoeias and the German Commission E Monograph.\nThe Health Canada natural health product monograph also states the use of ginger as an expectorant and antitussive to relieve symptoms of bronchitis, cough and colds.\nLiquorice (\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\nUse in Ayurveda\nThe Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India indexes the dried, unpeeled root of the liquorice plant as Yas.t.ī.\nIt is described to provide strength (Balya), treat ophthalmological disorders (Caksusya) and purify blood (Vatapittajit).\nAyurvedic uses of Yas.t.ī include treatment for cough (Kāsa), pulmonary tuberculosis (Ks.aya) and hoarseness of voice (Svarabheda).\nUse in Jamu\nLiquorice is traditionally used in Jamu for rheumatic diseases.\nIt is described in the official Indonesian Traditional Medicine Formularium for use against cough with phlegm.\nPharmacology\nGlycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid in liquorice have been shown to have corticosteroid-like activity, whilst liquiritin and its derivatives from liquorice extract were also reported to demonstrate antitussive effects.\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nThe WHO monograph on selected medicinal plants mentions the use of liquorice as a demulcent for sore throat and as an expectorant for cough and bronchial mucus build-up.\nThe Health Canada natural health product monograph states the use of liquorice in herbal medicine as an expectorant to relieve chest complaints, including for catarrhs, cough and bronchitis.\nTurmeric (\nCurcuma longa\nUse in Ayurveda\nTurmeric is referred to as Haridrā in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India.\nIt is described to possess anthelmintic (Kr.mighna), antileprotic (Kus.haghna), skin complexion-improving (Varn.ya), antidote (Vis.aghna) and antidiabetic (Pramehanāśaka) properties.\nTurmeric is used as an anti-inflammatory medicine as well as a galactagogue in Ayurvedic medicine.\nUse in Jamu\nTraditionally, turmeric is used in Jamu to treat many conditions, including asthma, hypertension and rheumatism.\nPharmacology\nThe anti-inflammatory activity of turmeric has been demonstrated in studies of experimentally induced inflammation.\nThe anti-inflammatory property of turmeric may be attributed to curcumin, believed to be the main anti-inflammatory constituent of turmeric, and its derivatives in scavenging oxygen radicals.\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nThe WHO monograph on selected medicinal plants states that the use of turmeric for the treatment of flatulence, acidity and atonic dyspepsia is supported by clinical data.\nThe monograph also mentions its use in pain and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis as well as for the treatment of asthma and cough.\nPeppermint (\nMenthae piperitae\nUse in Ayurveda\nPeppermint is indexed as Satva in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India.\nSatva is described to have appetite-stimulating (Dipana), antitussive (Kaphahara), oral hygiene-improving (Mukha-śodhana), digestive (Pācana) and analgesic (Śulapraśamana and Vedanāsthāpana) properties.\nTraditional use of Satva in Ayurveda includes relieving chronic fever (Jīrna jvara) and pain (Śūla).\nUse in Jamu\nThe use of peppermint in Jamu as described in the Indonesian Traditional Medicine Formularium is for use against sore throat and as an antiseptic against oral germs.\nPharmacology\nThe cooling sensation and analgesic properties elicited by peppermint are attributed to menthol.\nMenthol is widely used to relieve muscle and joint pains as this molecule stimulates analgesic effects.\nIn particular, menthol can bind and activate transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) ion channels, which play an essential role in detecting cold stimuli in peripheral sensory neurons.\nNerve fibres within the nasal mucosa are enriched with TRPM8 receptors.\nAccording to several preclinical studies, peppermint leaf extract, peppermint oil and menthol have been reported to also possess antispasmodic effects.\nThe antispasmodic effect of peppermint on tracheal muscle cells is likely through the inhibition of calcium channels, which in turn leads to smooth muscle relaxation.\nUse in allopathic and modern guidelines\nThe herbal monograph adopted by the European Medicines Agency Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products recommended the use of peppermint oil for symptomatic relief of mild tension-type headache based on well-established use in topical application and relief of symptoms in coughs and cold based on traditional use in inhalation, oral or cutaneous applications.\nA study involving healthy volunteers observed a significantly reduced mean number of coughs following evoked stimulation in participants who were administered inhaled peppermint.\nThe German Commission E Monograph has supported the use of peppermint oil for the treatment of catarrh and inflammation of the oral mucosa.\nThe WHO monograph on selected medicinal plants states that the use of peppermint is clinically proven for irritable bowel syndrome and headache.\nOther uses include treatment of fever, catarrh and cough.\nDiscussion\nThe inflammatory response is an important body defence mechanism during a viral cold infection for the prevention of spreading and killing of viruses.\nIt is often characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, tumour necrosis-α and IL-1β, giving rise to symptoms like cough, blocked nose, sore throat and fever.\nCurcumin, the active component of turmeric, is demonstrated to provide protection against inflammation via suppression of the NF-κB, PPARγ and TLR4 inflammation signalling pathways.\nClinically, consumption of curcumin supplement was reported to reduce common cold symptoms and shorten cold duration, although the inflammatory cytokine levels are highly variable in acute disease like the common cold.\nSimilar clinical anti- inflammatory actions by ginger were observed and exemplified in chronic and severe respiratory conditions.\nLiquorice and peppermint were clinically demonstrated to be effective antitussive agents against cough\nas well as to possess anti-inflammatory actions via corticosteroid-like activity\nand IL-10 modulation,\nrespectively.\nIn this review, we have surveyed the use of four herbal therapies – ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint – for the management of symptoms of the common cold as approached by the Ayurveda and Jamu medicinal systems. Overall, we have uncovered that these herbs have been used for centuries to treat symptoms of the common cold. Recent studies have supported their use in complementing modern evidence-based medicine.\nFurthermore, the use of these traditional herbal ingredients is supported by monographs from expert organizations such as WHO. However, whilst some studies may show limited objective benefit of inhaled aromatic ointments containing menthol for the common cold, the subjective benefits provided to patients have demonstrated improved sleep quality and accelerated recovery.\nFurthermore, the use of these traditional herbal ingredients is supported by monographs from expert bodies such as WHO.\nDespite the potential benefits of CAM, there are several issues surrounding the use of herbal ingredients for the treatment of the common cold in the general population. There are concerns regarding their safety as many herbal formulations are not tested or monitored with equal scrutiny as modern medicines.\nThese concerns are exacerbated by the lack of standardization, inappropriate labelling and inadequate patient information.\nHence, there is a need for regulatory bodies to proactively introduce measures to ensure patient safety in using herbal medicines.\nConclusion\nFor centuries, the Ayurveda and Jamu systems of medicine, originating from India and Indonesia, respectively, have leveraged herbal therapies to treat many illnesses. Herbs form the foundation of Ayurveda and Jamu, and ingredients like ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint have been used for centuries to treat several symptoms of the common cold. Recently, pharmacological evidence has demonstrated that the benefits of these herbal ingredients may be attributed to their anti-inflammatory effects.\nOn top of their traditional uses, herbal ingredients have seen an upsurge in acceptance in both the developing and developed world. Herbal ingredients like ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint have now been accepted into local and international monographs as suitable treatments for common cold symptoms. Given the widespread patient usage of CAM, a better understanding of this treatment paradigm by healthcare providers can be instrumental in bridging patient communication to potentially improve patient care. To improve healthcare provider acceptance of CAM, education should focus on the identity and pharmacology of phytochemicals in many herbal medicines as well as the clinical effectiveness of such molecules towards treating illnesses like the common cold.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Paulette Marks from Procter & Gamble South African Trading (Pty) Ltd for support in the expert roundtable implementation and Isuru Wijesoma, PhD, from McCann Health Singapore and Antony Hardjojo, PhD, from Jaya Medical Writing Pte Ltd for medical writing support for this article.\nFootnotes\nContributions:\nAll authors participated in the conceptualization, methodology, writing, original draft preparation, reviewing and editing of the manuscript.

The global incidence of ILI is estimated at 5–10% in adults and 20–30% in children. In India influenza accounts for 20–42% of monthly acute medical illness hospitalizations during the peak rainy season. AYUSH-64, a poly-herbal drug, is in practice for 40 years for various clinical conditions like fevers, microfilaremia, and inflammatory conditions.\nObjective\nA pilot study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ayurvedic formulation, AYUSH-64 in clinically diagnosed ILI for accelerating the recovery.\nMaterial and Methods\nA prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, single group, single-center pilot clinical study with pre-test and post-test design was conducted at Raja Ramdeo Anandilal Podar Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, Mumbai, an institute of Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) between June 2018 and July 2019. A total of 38 participants of clinically diagnosed ILI (18–65 years) were studied with an one-week intervention of ‘AYUSH 64’ in a dose of 3 gm/day and three weeks post-treatment observation period. Assessment of parameters viz. improvement in the symptoms of ILI, frequency of usage of acetaminophen, antihistaminic and cough syrup, hematology, liver function and kidney function tests along with incidence of secondary complications, and time to return to a normal routine was done.\nResults\nOne-week intervention of AYUSH 64 helped to recover from ILI symptoms with reduced frequency of usage of acetaminophen and antihistaminic. The intervention was safe on hematology and biochemical parameters. No serious adverse effects were observed during the study.\nConclusion\nAYUSH 64 along-with standard care in ILI is safe and efficacious and this may be used in other viral infections with pyrexia as add-on to standard care for early recovery and better outcome.\nKeywords:\nInfluenza-like illness (ILI),\nVata-Kaphaja Jvara\n, AYUSH 64, Safety, Efficacy, Ayurveda intervention\n1. Introduction\nInfluenza is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide including low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in tropical regions like India where highest point estimates rates of Influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza-associated ILI among young and older adults [\n]. ILI refers to a wide range of viral infections with clinical manifestation ranging from fever, malaise and other constitutional symptoms mostly depending upon tissue, organ affected, host defense, age of the patient, and the affecting strain of the virus and bacterial load. Management of uncomplicated ILI remains symptom-based rather than antiviral therapy where in antipyretic, antihistaminic or cough syrup is used for symptomatic relief which again has its own side effects. Patients are advised to take rest and maintain proper hydration during illness and asked to return to full activity after gradual recovery from illness. Viruses constantly change their antigenicity as a strategy for evasion from immune-mediated elimination [\nThe clinical presentation of ILI is similar with\nVata-Kapha Jvara\n(fever with predominance of\nVata and Kapha dosha\n) as per the description in Ayurveda classics [\n]. The treatment of\naims at digestion of\n(partially digested metabolic waste) through\nlanghana\n(fasting/restricted calorie intake) and formulations (single herb/polyherbal) containing ingredients having\ntikta rasa, ushna virya, katu vipaka\namapachaka\n(anti-inflammatory) properties [\n]. Many botanicals which are documented in Ayurveda Pharmacopoeia viz.\nSwertia chirata\nKiratatikta), Alstonia scholaris (Saptaparna), Pircrorria kurroa (Kutaki)\netc. are traditionally used for fevers like malaria [\n]. AYUSH 64, a polyherbal formulation is in practice since 1980s against various conditions like fevers, inflammation and joint pains across CCRAS peripheral institutes. Its efficacy has been reported in conditions like\nVishamjvara\n(malarial fever),\nShleepada\n(microfilaremia) and chikungunya. During the malaria epidemic in Rajasthan and Assam in 1994 and 1996 respectively, AYUSH 64 was used in 3600 fever cases in Rajasthan and 2294 fever cases in Assam. A decline in infectivity rate was observed when AYUSH 64 was given to all fever cases along with anti-malarial, and a good response was reported in villages where AYUSH 64 administration was done on prophylaxis basis for fever cases [\nVishamjvara\nVata-kapha jvara\nvis-à-vis ILI are the types of\nand share common pathology, however\nKapha doshas\nare predominant in ILI and manifest symptoms as\nShitaka\n(chills),\nGaurava\n(heaviness),\nParvaruka\n(pain in small joints),\nPratishyaya\n(cold/catarrh), and\n(cough), etc. The ingredients in AYUSH 64 are\nJwarahara\n(useful in fevers)\n, Shwasa-Kaasaghna\n(useful in asthma, cough)\n, Shothahara\n(relieves inflammation). Details of pharamalogical profile of plant ingredients present in AYUSH 64 is provided in\nTable 1\n. On this background, this pilot study was aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of AYUSH64 in the management of clinically diagnosed ILI.\nTable 1.\nDetails of pharmacological profile of plant ingredients present in AYUSH 64.\nName of the plant\nVipaaka\nSaptaparna\n(Alstonia scholaris\nR.

Methods\n2.1. Study design and trail site\nAs 4-week single-center pilot study was conducted in a prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single group, pre and post-test design at Raja Ramdeo Anandilal Podar Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer, an institute of CCRAS, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India.\n2.2. Patient enrolment and inclusion criteria\nPatients who were clinically diagnosed cases with ILI having axillary temperature ≥38 °C and with at least two constitutional symptoms (headache, chills, myalgia or fatigue) and one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat or coryza) with the onset of illness since not more than 36 h, of either sex, age between 18 and 65 years and who voluntarily signed the informed consent to participate in the study were included in the study.\n2.3. Exclusion criteria\nExclusion criteria were the following: Cases of bronchitis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, interstitial lesions, patients having white blood cells (WBC) count greater than the upper limit of normal (WBC>11.0 × 10\nL) and lesser than normal (WBC<4.0 × 10\n/L) or neutrophil count ≥75%, patients coughing purulent sputum or with suppurative tonsillitis, patients with uncontrolled diabetes, COPD, hepatic insufficiency (ALT or AST 2 times above normal or higher); renal insufficiency (serum creatinine more than the upper lab value); chronic congestive heart failure, psychiatric diseases, patients who already have taken antiviral drugs or related traditional medicine after the onset/before the screening, women in pregnancy or lactation period, women of childbearing age with a plan of a pregnancy, immune-compromised patients or taking immunosuppressant in last 3 months, with dubious or confirmed alcohol and drug abuse history, suffering from an acute respiratory infection, otitis media or sinusitis 2 weeks before, with history of vaccination for seasonal or new influenza A (H1N1) vaccine 6 months before.\n2.4. Consent and ethical approval\n2.5. Intervention\nThe study drug AYUSH-64 was procured from Indian Medicines Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited (IMPCL) Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Each capsule of AYUSH 64 consists of\nA. scholaris\nR. Br (\nSaptaparna)\nbark aqueous extract 100 mg,\nkurroa\nRoyle ex. Benth\n(Katuki\n) root aqueous extract 100 mg,\nhirata\nPexbex. Karst (\nKiratatikta\n) whole-plant aqueous extract 100 mg,\ncrista\nKuberaksha\n) seed powder 200 mg. Quality control and safety parameters of the ingredients and the formulation complied with API limits/Inhouse limits as appropriate (Quality Control Analysis enclosed as\nsupplementary files\nThe drug was given in a dose of 2 capsules (500 mg) thrice daily i.e. 3 gm/day orally after food along-with water for 7 days from baseline. One of the authors, a specialist in modern medicine prescribed acetaminophen, antihistaminic and cough syrup as per the standard guidelines and monitored the patients along with\nAyurveda\nphysicians.\n2.6. Outcome measure/efficacy evaluation\nThe efficacy evaluation of the drug was done by assessing the ILI symptoms viz. fever, headache, myalgia, running nose, nasal obstruction/congestion, cough, sore throat, fatigue, chills/aversion to cold and sweating. The symptoms were assessed on a scale of 0–100 cm using VAS, where 0 represents no symptom and 100 represents the maximum severity of the symptom [\n]. These symptoms were assessed at baseline and on 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day. Improvement in fever was measured as time to defervescence, i.e. the time from the first dose of study medication to the time when the body temperature declined to 37.4 °C or below and was sustained for ≥24 h. Severity of the illness was assessed by computing the area under the curve (AUC) for all the symptoms together. Average score of all the ten symptoms for each patient was computed for calculating the AUC. The area under the curve was evaluated between two consecutive time points. Integration approximating with the trapezoidal rule was used to calculate the areas [\n]. The frequency of usage of acetaminophen, antihistaminic and cough syrup and incidence of secondary complications of ILI e.g. bronchitis, otitis media, pneumonitis etc. and adverse reactions related to the intervention were noted at all visits. The time to return to normal state of health and activity was defined as the time (in hours) from study drug initiation to the first 24h period in which participants returned to their normal state and remained so for 24h. The participants were assessed for Ayurvedic variables with the interest to study diagnostic classifications according to\nAyurved\nTable 2\nTable 2.\nTimeline procedure of the study.\nTime Points\nSchedule of Activity\nPrior to selection (Screening Visit)\nInformed consent\nEligibility evaluation\nAssessment for ILI symptoms\nGeneral and systemic examination\nLaboratory Investigations (CBC, Urine, LFT, KFT, ECG)\nDuring Selection (Baseline Visit, 0 day)\nDetailed case history along with assessment of Ayurvedic Parameters\nIssue of the trial drug and drug compliance form (DCF)\nDuring Intervention (3\nClinical assessment\nResponse assessment for ILI symptoms using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)\nRecord of the need for any rescue/concomitant medication\nRecord drug compliance and ADR/ADE\nEnd of Intervention (7\nClinical assessment\nResponse assessment for ILI symptoms using VAS\nRecord of the need for any rescue/concomitant medication\nLaboratory Investigations (CBC, Urine, LFT, KFT)\nRecord drug compliance and ADR/ADE\nObtaining remaining trial drug from participant\nPost Intervention- Follow-up (14\nand 21\nClinical assessment\nResponse assessment for ILI symptoms using VAS\nRecord of the need for any rescue/concomitant medication\nPost Intervention Follow-up (28\nClinical assessment\nResponse assessment for ILI symptoms using VAS\nRecord of need of any rescue/concomitant medication\nLaboratory Investigations (CBC)\nOpen in a new tab\n2.7.

Secondary complications of ILI were not observed during the study period in any participant. No serious adverse reactions related to the intervention were reported in any participant.\n4. Discussion\nILI refers to a wide range of viral infections, quite common in children and old people due to lowered immunity. The conventional management of ILI depends on severity, mild to moderate cases of category A and B are managed by acetaminophen, antihistaminic and severe cases of category C are treated with antiviral, antibiotics, intravenous fluids and other supportive care [\n]. In an internet-based cohort study, it was found that the quality-adjusted life-day (QALD) loss was found to be over three times higher for ILI than for acute respiratory infections [\n]. Early recovery is needed for returning to jobs/works along-with arrest to spread of infection. The innate immune response plays a crucial role in the viral elimination and recovery from disease.\nIt is reported that the symptom scores in influenza infections are directly correlated with IL-6 and IFN-α [\n]. Significant production of IL-6, TNF- α, IFN- α, IFN-γ and IL-10 occurs in response to community acquired influenza A illness [\n]. Bian et al. has noted that the levels of interleukin (IL)- 6, IL-33 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α were significantly higher in Influenza A patients while IL-6, IL-17 A, IL-29, interferon (IFN)- γ and interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10 were significantly higher in Influenza B patients [\nMultiple host-based intervention strategies against influenza are under development and these offer advantages over conventional antivirals. New therapeutic options in the treatment of Influenza infection will be targeting virus-induced metabolic changes to restore host normal metabolism, and research in the immunometabolism field along with studies on modulating immune response [\n]. A class of herbal medicines, known as immunomodulators vis-à-vis\nRasayana\n, modulate the secretion of multiple cytokines [\nThe botanicals in AYUSH-64, reported to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity. The aqueous bark extract of\nA. scholaris\nin BALB/c mouse induced the cellular immune response at 50 mg/kg body weight once a day for 7 consecutive days while at 100 mg/kg body weight inhibited the delayed type of hypersentivity reaction [\n]. Yun-Li Zhao et al. studied the effects of indole alkaloids and total alkaloids of\nA. scholaris\non post infectious cough in mice and airway inflammation in rats respectively. Indole alkaloids showed down-regulation of inflammatory cells, cytokines (IL-6) and the balance of antioxidants. Total alkaloids inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung [\nThe biopolymeric fraction RLJ-NE-205 from the rhizomes of\nkurroa\nimproved the immune system of mouse through increased proliferation of lymphocytes and cytokine levels (IL-4 and IFN-gamma) in serum, phagocytic index and CD4/CD8 population [\n]. Pre-treatment with\nkurroa\nrhizome extract exhibited anti-inflammatory activity through the suppression of macrophage-derived cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10) and mediators via suppression of NF-κB signaling [\n]. Picroside II, active ingredient from\nscrophulariiflora\nshowed the promising effects of anti-inflammation in cells and animals through decrease in concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. It suppressed the activation of p65 NF-κB signaling pathway compared with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The pathologic changes of lung tissues had been alleviated and lung wet/dry weight ratio was decreased after Picroside II treatment [\nSwertia chirata\nis found to inhibit NF-kB/DNA interactions and also reduced pro-inflammatory IL- 8 expression in cystic fibrosis cells at IC\nconcentrations [\n]. Bellidifolin and Swerchirin, the two main xanthones from\nchirata\ninhibit the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- α. Bellidifolin potently inhibited the prostaglandin E\n) by suppressing the protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [\n]. The CHCl\nsoluble, crude extract of the whole\nchirata\ninhibited the expression of Viral protein R (Vpr) in HeLa cells harboring the TREx plasmid encoding full-length Vpr (TREx-HeLa-Vpr cells) [\n]. Crude extract of\nswertia\nplant showed antiviral properties against Herpes simplex virus type-1 [\nAdministration of methanolic extracts of\nC. crista\nreduced TNF- α, IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA expression in hippocampus and the frontal cortex brain areas in rats [\nCaesalpinia bonducella\nseed extract produced dose dependent increase in both the parameters, i.e. antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity in rats indicating promising immunostimulant properties [\n]. A water-soluble gluco-arabinan isolated from the alkaline extract of the endosperm of seeds of\nC. bonducella\nshowed immunostimulant activity through splenocytes and thymocytes activations [\n]. Whole ethanolic seed extract of\nC. bonducella\nseeds in experimental albino rats displayed anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities [\nAs per the Ayurvedic understanding, the weakened\nleads to formation of\nproinflammatory undigested substance\nleading to\namavastha\nthat results into weak immune status. The Ayurvedic management aims at correction of\nstatus through\nAgnideepana\nAmapachana\nresulting into\nniramavastha\n(devoid of\n) i.e. reversing the pathology and improving the immune status. The ingredients in AYUSH 64 are having\nTikta rasa\nwhich is\nAgnideepak and Amapachak\n(anti-inflammatory). AYUSH 64 acts as\namapachaka\nand converts the status from\nnirama. Niramavastha\nresults into restoring the normal metabolism and strengthening immune status.\nIn this study, the declining trend in symptoms of ILI is seen from the 3rd day of intervention to the 7th day. The combination effect of botanicals is\nJwarahara\n(relieves fever)\n, Kasahara\n(useful in cough), and\nShwasahara\n(useful in asthma). This effect is seen from the reduction in the requirement of acetaminophen from 3rd day onwards after the intervention and minimal use of antihistaminic and cough syrup during the study period. The recovery time and returning to normal life was 3rd day in 6 patients, 7th day for 17 patients and 14th day for 3 patients. The seven-day treatment of AYUSH 64 along with standard care has shown reduction in symptoms of majority patients. Symptoms like fever,\nsvedapravartana, shitaka, staimitya\ntandra\nparvaruk\nhave shown sharp decline by 7th day of intervention. The post-treatment follow-up period has seen mild symptoms and requirement of antihistaminic and acetaminophen in 7 patients. Declining trend was seen in all the symptoms of ILI with fairly early recovery, however a longer duration of AYUSH 64 may have shown better results in terms of the restoration of metabolism and further strengthening the immune status. As far herb–drug interaction is concerned, AYUSH 64 was used along-with standard antimalarial treatment in earlier malaria epidemic. In this study the seven-day administration of AYUSH 64 along with standard care was tolerated well and no adverse events were recorded.\n4.1. Limitations\nThis is single-group pre and post test design study with a small sample size and was focused on clinically diagnosed ILI condition with only clinical safety related biochemical parameters. However, for substantial evidence, a larger multicentric study with a robust design with standard diagnostic investigations and cytokine response will be helpful to validate the efficacy of this drug.\n5. Conclusion\nAYUSH 64 along-with standard care in ILI is safe and efficacious and it may be used in other viral infections with pyrexia as an add-on to standard care for early recovery and better outcome.\nClinical Trial Registry\nClinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), number: CTRI/2017/10/010145.\nSource of support\nCCRAS, Ministry of AYUSH, GoI.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors are thankful to CCRAS, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India for grants for this study under CCRAS Research policy.\nFootnotes\nPeer review under responsibility of Transdisciplinary University, Bangalore.\nAppendix A\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2020.05.010\nAppendix A.

It involves problem definition, followed by solution design, solution implementation, and, finally, review. Healthcare is a prime and often successful example of problem-solving. In medical terminology, the problem definition is termed the diagnosis, the solution design is called the treatment plan, and the solution itself is the provision of treatment. The case review is used to assess the efficacy of the solution. This process is sequential and consequential. Obviously, if a problem’s definition is absent or incorrect, then an appropriate solution cannot be designed or implemented. Unfortunately, missed or incorrect diagnoses are not uncommon in healthcare and can cause considerable harm and economic cost. Minimizing these diagnostic errors would confer great benefits to patients, clinicians, and healthcare organizations. Understanding the nature of diagnosis and why it can be so difficult are some of the first steps in reducing these diagnostic errors. One issue is that diagnosis may seem to be more of an art than a science when the exact mechanisms of diagnosis are often not clearly described. Clinicians typically learn their diagnostic craft by mimicry of their mentors over years of hard experience. This absence of a clear method not only makes diagnosis difficult to do well it also makes diagnosis difficult to teach well. The purpose of this paper is to try to better articulate the fundamental principles and methods of diagnosis and to make diagnosis more intellectually understandable, and so more teachable, and more achievable by clinicians.\nKeywords:\nclinical decision rules, decision support techniques, clinical decision making, diagnostic error, diagnostic systems, diagnostic technique\nIntroduction and background\nProblem-solving is an important part of human activity. Typically, problems are identified, solutions are designed and implemented, and the outcome is reviewed. In healthcare, the main problem to be solved is a disease. Identification of disease is termed diagnosis, the solution design is called treatment planning, and treatment where appropriate is then implemented as the solution. Case review determines the outcome. These four stages are linearly dependent. Therefore, an error in diagnosis can lead to consequent errors in treatment planning, hence in treatment given, which then leads to a poor outcome on review. Incorrect diagnoses may cause patient harm, operator stress, and economic loss [\n]. Unfortunately, diagnostic errors are commonplace [\n]. There is a need to minimize these diagnostic errors and their harm [\n]. This is often difficult when healthcare domains are usually complex and incompletely understood, even by domain experts [\n]. Moreover, effective teaching of diagnostic skills requires that the principles are consciously understood [\n]. The aim of this paper is to describe the fundamentals of the diagnostic process to aid its understanding, teaching, and implementation.\nReview\nThe language of diagnosis\nThe term diagnosis is part of the fabric of medical language, and indeed elsewhere. Despite this ubiquity, many users may be oblivious to the origin of the word, which remarkably tells us its fundamental meaning. It is no accident that in the 1600s the word diagnosis was derived from two Latin words, which, in turn, came from ancient Greek. The English-language versions of the two words are\ngnosis\n(“to know”) and\n(“apart”) (Figure\n]. These two words indicate an ability to recognize (know) one condition as separate (apart) from another; that is, to discriminate between health and disease and between different diseases. That the original literal meaning has endured so precisely into modern times demonstrates the word’s utility.\nFigure 1. Google search: etymology of the word diagnosis.\nOpen in a new tab\nSo, we now know the meaning of the word diagnosis. But the word alone does not instruct us how to make a diagnosis, or how to teach a diagnostic method. Making a diagnosis is done by system analysis.\nSystem analysis\nTo understand a diagnostic method, it is essential to consider the fundamental system in which a diagnosis is to be made [\n]. This can be complicated, so bear with me. At a basic level, our patient is made up of many aggregated complex parts and processes [\n]. This complex whole system is difficult to understand when the different parts and processes obscure each other, often confounding the interpretation of cause and effect. The scientific method uses deconstruction to break up that complexity into smaller isolated parts, which can be more easily understood with logic [\n]. Once properly understood, these smaller structures and mechanisms are then used to explain the behavior of the full working system as a model. So, to understand the system one has to identify its parts. Those parts can be described as elements or components [\n]. These system elements are defined by us as they occur in nature, or at least as we perceive them.\nEach element in the system can be working well or may be malfunctioning. In a healthy system, all elements will be in their correct state. Alternatively, if one or more elements are malfunctioning, then the system may malfunction, and in the medical sense, the disease is present [\n]. Many of these elements may be unrelated, but others may be linked, such that when one element varies then another element changes as well. Such a linkage between elements leads to consequences and dependence on downstream elements. In this way, an effect might propagate through the system from one element to the next as a relationship. If the nature of the relationship between elements is known, then the propagation of the effect would be predictable and could be described by logic rules or other reasoning methods. One or more logic rules can then define the model of the system’s behavior.\nLogic applied to a known element and its relationship to another element is the primary method to obtain a diagnosis [\n]. An example of such a logic statement might be the conclusion that increased redness of a body part may be due to increased blood flow at a histological level, which in some cases may be an indicator of the presence of inflammatory disease. This was first stated by the Roman, Celsus, in BC 30-38 [\n], perhaps the first recorded diagnostician.\nWhile useful, one logic statement about one system element may not be enough to clearly conclude a specific diagnosis. Several diagnoses could still be possible with that one element’s status. For example, reddened skin could be an indication of a traumatic injury, a sunburn, a noxious chemical, or merely a person being healthy but just too hot. Fortunately, the diagnostic method can be improved by considering multiple elements together. Typically, a malfunction propagates through the system from one or a few initial elements to affect multiple other dependent elements and thus magnifying the effect. This causes a cascade of malfunctioning elements to occur together, some of which then become detectable, all together. This situation gives the opportunity to cross-reference individual logic statements at the same time. One element may logically preclude or alternatively dictate some disease diagnoses. However, multiple logic statements together can then deduce a narrower subset of diagnoses, or even a single specific diagnosis. Considering multiple elements together becomes a more powerful way of discriminating any disease present.\nRather than laboriously reasoning each logic statement with its peers, an intellectual shortcut for this technique is simply to identify the defined set of failing elements that are known to occur in a specific pattern for a specific disease. Hence, pattern recognition is the second method by which a diagnosis is made [\n]. All one has to do is to remember each specific pattern that is indicative of each specific disease. An example of such pattern recognition might be used to conclude that tissue with increased redness, warmth, swelling, and pain all occurring together is suffering histological-level inflammation, such as dermatitis. These particular inflammation signs in such a pattern were, of course, first described as rubor, calor, tumor, and dolor in Roman times by Celsus [\n]. He understood this pattern recognition.\nIn the example above, clearly, redness, heat, swelling, and pain are not the initial failed elements causing the inflammatory disease. The disease usually occurs as a cascade of failing elements. It is common that the initial elements which fail often are microscopic, biochemical, internal, and difficult to detect clinically. However, their failure often leads to later consequential downstream failures of external elements, which may be clinically detectable. In such cases, the hidden internal failing elements can then be logically predicted from the altered and detectable external elements in the clinical domain. We call these proxy external elements symptoms if reported by our patient, and signs if detected by the clinician, perhaps with further tests. Some elements may be both a symptom and a sign if both clinician and patient detect them. Such external signs and symptoms exist as the result of the logic rules and fall into the patterns detected by the clinical diagnostic method.\nFurthermore, it can be seen that any disease process can be considered at two levels. A pathologist may describe the failing internal elements in great detail, typically on a microscopic, histological, or biochemical level [\n]. The clinician meanwhile views the same disease as external failing elements, typically as clinically detectable macroscopic signs and symptoms. It is as if the one disease is being described in two languages; that of the pathologist, and that of the clinician. Clinical diagnosis translates from the language of external signs and symptoms to the corresponding internal language of pathology, which specifies the disease label. Therefore, the process of diagnosis is like a translation between these two languages. Healthcare training thus teaches the two associated sets of information for each and every disease: the internal pathological features of the medical sciences, and the corresponding clinical features of signs and symptoms. Clinicians and pathologists need to be bilingual to be able to speak both languages.\nInexperienced clinicians may need to consciously think through each logic step or pattern matching, but with training, the diagnostic process may occur without explicit thought [\n]. Subconscious thinking has been termed System 1, as it is routine for experienced clinicians. Labored and slower conscious logical thought has been called System 2 [\n]. It may take years of instruction and practice for a clinician to become an expert at automated System 1 correlation for many diseases. But when a diagnosis is difficult even experienced clinicians may have to resort to System 2 [\n]. Not reverting to the slower conscious logic techniques (metacognition) where appropriate can lead to misdiagnoses [\n], although, as expected, one report showed that very expert clinicians could diagnose so well that more time did not improve their already good accuracy [\n]. Improved clinical and pathology knowledge [\n] and diagnostic checklists [\n] have also been proposed to reduce diagnostic errors.\nHow clinicians obtain and then ascribe value to clinical information has also been extensively studied [\n]. The clinician is initially in a position of ignorance at the start of the consultation. A series of three phases then occurs: to acquire data, to form a working hypothesis of possible diagnoses, and then to test and hopefully confirm a specific diagnosis with more data [\n]. Logic and pattern matching are used throughout, either consciously or subconsciously. Figure\ngives a protocol of the stages of the diagnostic process. The process is iterative so that if a diagnosis is not made, then more data can be collected and the process can be repeated. Perhaps counterintuitively, more experienced clinicians were found to spend more time on the initial data acquisition than did medical students, who tended to more quickly assume a diagnosis, perhaps in error [\nFigure 2. Diagnostic protocol.\nOpen in a new tab\nChallenges in diagnosis\nTherefore, the diagnostic method seems to be relatively straightforward to do. It is just logic statements and pattern recognition of disease models. Simple, right? So, how come diagnosis can often be very difficult? This is because there are some serious practical problems that can very much hinder the process.\nImperfect System Models\nFirst, disease systems are usually very complicated, and not all diseases are fully described or understood. Their etiology and pathogenesis may not have been clearly established as clear logic statements or as recognizable patterns [\n]. This ignorance can prevent diagnosis and motivates much ongoing medical research.\nUndetectable Elements\n]. Therefore, diagnosis relying on such totally hidden elements is impossible. This is frustrating, especially when such hidden failing elements are often causal of the disease, and so would be highly diagnostic. Figure\nshows a Venn diagram of the relationship of the detectable information within the wider hidden information. An experienced clinician may in some cases be able to correctly interpolate absent information.\nFigure 3. System data and its analysis for clinical diagnosis.\nOpen in a new tab\nMisinformation\nThe clinician also may have to cope with some misinformation (Figure\n], errors occur in clinical and laboratory tests and radiographs, and mistakes may be made in recording clinical data. Good diagnostic acumen includes the ability to disregard misinformation where appropriate.\nNatural Variation\nThe fourth practical problem is the natural variation found in all of nature. Charles Darwin explained his theory of evolution on the basis that system elements would be typically variable in a population of organisms [\n]. As the environment changes, this variance permits the survival of some fortunate members of a species under new selection pressures, leading to species adaptation. While this variance is useful in species survival by evolution, it can be the bane of a clinician’s efforts to diagnose her patients. The same disease in different patients, or even in the same patient at different times, can present with a different pattern of detectable elements [\n]. Some elements that are normally present may be absent. And some elements that are normally absent may be present. Indeed, there is a spectrum from health to disease, not necessarily with a clear demarcation between the two states. Significant variations in case presentations may put diagnoses in doubt. The logic and pattern recognition methods described above have to accommodate these natural variations, errors, and omissions. The diagnostic process therefore can be regarded as imperfectly defined or fuzzy in nature. Fuzzy logic [\n] is required to reach a diagnosis in the presence of natural variation [\n]. Rigid thinkers may be disappointed.\nWorkplace Limitations\nMedical workplaces are often stressful and busy environments where the workload is excessive [\n]. Repetitive tasking and fatigue may dull the observational senses and the mind [\nThe limits of diagnostic method\nDiagnosis and education\nIt can be seen from the above analysis that like many other skills, initially, the diagnosis has to be consciously learned [\n]. At first, we may not realize the full extent of our lack of skill. This has been termed unconscious incompetence [\n]. With education, a person moves on to realize they are unskilled (conscious incompetence), then hopefully with much intellectual analysis and effort they become consciously competent (System 2 behavior [\n]). Finally, when they are very experienced they may become unconsciously competent (System 1 behavior [\n]) and be able to perform the task without specifically analyzing each step. This learning transition was first proposed by Noel Burch in the 1970s for training staff in businesses and is now an established educational model [\n]. The final unconscious competence relies largely on what might be described as intuition, learned by years of experience [\n]. But in the earlier learning stages, the clinician must use rigorous conscious logic and pattern recognition to laboriously conclude the diagnosis [\n]. Hence, an emphasis by educators should be to provide clear and detailed explanations of the known logic rules and the patterns of both pathological and clinical elements associated with each specific state of health and disease. The student will then have some rational framework with which to consciously translate the external signs and symptoms into internal diagnoses of pathosis [\n]. Experienced clinical educators who can not deconstruct their own unconscious competence into defined conscious and rational statements will not optimize their students’ learning. The art of diagnosis needs to be transformed into an explicit and explainable science to be readily teachable to inexperienced operators [\nClinical diagnostic adages\nNo account of the clinical diagnostic process would be complete without mentioning some clinical adages that are in common use.\nFirst, it has been said that “one’s ears are the best diagnostic tool,” with evidence from a patient’s history often trumping complex and expensive special investigations [\n]. More emphasis on the clinical history and examination is helpful before special investigations are requested.\nSecond, any reported symptoms should be confirmed with a related clinical sign. Reproducing the symptom with an associated clinical sign confirms the validity of the history.\nThird, another useful concept is, where appropriate, to try to deduce an individual diagnosis for each tissue, process, or body part under investigation. This more detailed diagnosis by individual sites can lead to a more precisely tailored treatment plan. Each of these tissues or body parts may need specific but different management at different time stages.\nFourth, the adage that “common things are common” reminds us of the greater probability of a routine condition compared with an extraordinarily rare disease, notwithstanding the need to discount rare conditions.\nFinally, when a diagnosis is still in doubt, in all but the most extreme circumstances, it is critical that harmful intervention is not provided until a dependable diagnosis is obtained. Repetition of the diagnostic process, additional investigations, further opinions from colleagues, or just allowing more time may lead to a clear diagnosis.\nPrimum non nocere\nConclusions\nIn summary, misdiagnoses in healthcare are common and cause much harm and cost. The diagnostic method uses two fundamental reasoning techniques: individual or multiple logic statements, and pattern recognition of failing disease elements. Many elements are out of view of the clinician who must reverse translate the external signs and symptoms into internal diseased elements to deduce the internal diagnosis. While experienced clinicians may be able to do much of this reasoning subconsciously, inexperienced clinicians must consciously deliberate each logic step and pattern. Although observation of clinical cases is a valuable learning exercise, clinical teachers will accelerate their students’ learning by providing the deconstructed reasoning behind each diagnosis. The aim here is to better rationalize the diagnostic process, to allow it to be better taught, and to allow clinicians to become better diagnosticians. Without knowing disease from health, or one disease from another, reliable design and delivery of therapy are not possible. It is sobering to realize that someone over 300 years ago knew this when they coined the word “diagnosis” to “know apart.”\nThe content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

The definitions and illustrative examples provided here will be useful for developers of diagnostic expert systems.\nDescription of the Problem\nRepresenting medical knowledge is a highly complex endeavor. The improper use of the terms “syndrome”, “disease” and their relations to “diagnosis” is one of the difficulties with which medical informaticians must deal, especially when developing expert systems to support diagnoses. Although ubiquitous in medical and lay discourse, the term “disease” has no unambiguous, generally accepted definition. However, most of those using this term allow themselves the comfortable delusion that everyone knows what it means.\nOnly sparse and fragmented literature could be found regarding this issue.\nPurpose\nThe different concepts about “what types of conditions may be said to constitute a disease” will be discussed. The “unorthodox” ways in which terms “disease” and “syndrome” are being used, as well as their different interrelationships, will be shown.\nIllustrative cases will be used to present potentially ambiguous situations found when representing medical knowledge in expert systems.\nThe “Disease Entity” Assumption\nDiagnostic categories (diseases and most syndromes) are simply concepts. They are justified only if they provide a useful framework for organizing and explaining the complexity of clinical experience in order to derive inferences about outcome and if they guide decisions about treatment.\nsyndrome\nis a recognizable complex of symptoms and physical findings which indicate a specific condition for which a direct cause is not necessarily understood. Thus in practice doctors refer to the infamous “viral syndrome” as such because of the uncertainty regarding the legion of viral agents that is causing the illness. Once medical science identifies a causative agent or process with a fairly high degree of certainty, physicians may then refer to the process as a\ndisease\n, not a syndrome. Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome became Kawasaki syndrome which in turn metamorphosed into Kawasaki disease; the latter is properly a disease, no longer a syndrome, by virtue of its clearly identifiable diagnostic features and disease progression, and response to specific treatment.\nAlbert\net al.\ncatalogued six general views or concepts about what types of conditions may be said to constitute a disease. These views range from nominalism and cultural-relativistic theories (i.e. some conditions become a disease when a profession or a society labels it as such) to a “disease realism” view (objectively demonstrable departure from adaptive biological functioning). The latter model is the one best suited to the present state of medicine; it emphasizes that the clinical signs and symptoms do not constitute the disease and that it is not until causal mechanisms are clearly identified that we can say we have “really” discovered the disease.\nMedical literature, even that from governmental organizations and institutions authorized to implement standards, is plagued with misleading assertions such as “a syndrome is a disease …”, “a syndrome indicates a particular disease…” and “Lyme disease syndrome” (It is inappropriate to apply “syndrome” to Lyme disease because its causative agent is known).\nSome syndromes such as “heart failure” are useful medical concepts but are not diagnoses, whereas more specific syndromes such as “congestive heart failure” or “right heart failure” are diagnoses\n. Due to the imprecision of natural language, some syndromes could also imply a simple pathological finding (vasculitis) or just a physical finding. Frequently, for example, arthritis syndromes are simply referred to as “arthritis”.\nReferences\nAlbert DA, Munson R, Resnik MD: Reasoning in Medicine.

However, the diagnostic accuracy of the numbers of symptoms has not been well studied. This study aims to use equations and simulations to demonstrate how the factors that determine symptom incidence influence symptoms’ diagnostic accuracy for disease diagnosis. Assuming a disease causing symptoms and correlated with the other disease in 10,000 simulated subjects, 40 symptoms occurred based on 3 epidemiological measures: proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence (among those not diseased), and risk ratios. Symptoms occurred with similar correlation coefficients. The sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis were exhibited as equations using the three epidemiological measures and approximated using linear regression in simulated populations. The areas under curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was the measure to determine the diagnostic accuracy of multiple symptoms, derived by using 2 to 40 symptoms for disease diagnosis. With respect to each AUC, the best set of sensitivity and specificity, whose difference with 1 in the absolute value was maximal, was chosen. The results showed sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis were fully explained with the three epidemiological measures in simulated subjects. The AUCs increased or decreased with more symptoms used for disease diagnosis, when the risk ratios were greater or less than 1, respectively. Based on the AUCs, with risk ratios were similar to 1, symptoms did not provide diagnostic values. When risk ratios were greater or less than 1, maximal or minimal AUCs usually could be reached with less than 30 symptoms. The maximal AUCs and their best sets of sensitivities and specificities could be well approximated with the three epidemiological and interaction terms, adjusted R-squared ≥ 0.69. However, the observed overall symptom correlations, overall symptom incidence, and numbers of symptoms explained a small fraction of the AUC variances, adjusted R-squared ≤ 0.03. In conclusion, the sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis can be explained fully by the at-risk incidence and the 1 minus baseline incidence, respectively. The epidemiological measures and baseline symptom correlations can explain large fractions of the variances of the maximal AUCs and the best sets of sensitivities and specificities. These findings are important for researchers who want to assess the diagnostic accuracy of composite diagnostic criteria.\nSubject terms:\nEpidemiology, Computational models, Epidemiology, Population screening\nIntroduction\nSymptoms that are considered signs of certain diseases have been used for diagnostic purposes such as those used for the diagnosis of frailty and mental illnesses\n. The diagnostic accuracy of these symptoms varies over a wide range\n. The number of symptoms used to diagnose varies across diagnoses\nand even for the same diagnosis\n. For example,\nfrailty\n, a geriatric syndrome, has been defined and diagnosed with 4 to 70 symptoms, depending on the frailty models\n. More complicated frailty models define and use more frailty symptoms for diagnosis\n. Since various designs and model specifications coexist, it remains unclear whether there are optimal numbers of symptoms for the diagnosis of a disease, for example, frailty.\nIn a simplistic hypothetical case (see Table\n), a proportion of a population is affected by a disease, denoted by\n, and a constant and random rate of incidence occurs for one symptom at a particular time point, denoted by\n. For those affected by the disease, the incidence rate of the symptoms increases by a risk ratio, denoted by\n. With respect to the individuals diseased, the proportion of those presenting the symptom was\nand the proportion of those not presenting the symptom was\n(1 − ir\n.

In detail, there were only two diseases. One directly influenced the incidence of the symptoms, and the other was only associated with the disease. The incidence rates and risk ratios were similar with respect to all the simulated symptoms. The products of the incidence rates and risk ratios (at-risk incidence) could not exceed 1, an upper limit of incidence rate of 100%. There were 10,000 individuals simulated each time. There were 40 symptoms induced by the disease. The correlations between the disease and the other associated disease were 0, 0.3, and 0.7. We assumed the prevalence rates of the disease were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8, similar to the values adopted in a previous study\n. Several conditions have been observed in more than 80% of selected populations, for example, Epstein–Barr virus infection\nand the herpes simplex virus type 2 infection\n. The baseline incidence of developing symptoms for those not affected by the disease were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8. The risk ratios of developing symptoms when diseased were 0.5 (less likely to develop symptoms), 1.0 (equally likely to develop symptoms), 2, 5, 10, and 25 (more likely to develop symptoms). Risk ratios more than 25 were reported in several studies\n. We assumed the correlations between the symptoms were 0, 0.4, and 0.8, similar to a range in a previous study\n. We assumed the correlations between the diseases were 0, 0.3, and 0.7. We used 10 simulations for each combination of disease correlations, disease prevalence, symptom incidence, symptom correlations, and risk ratios of developing symptoms.\nTable 3.\nAssumptions and the assessments of the simulated symptoms.\nAssumptions\n2 diseases of interest: one disease directly related to the symptoms and the other associated with the disease only (unrelated to symptoms)\nSimilar baseline incidence rates among those not diseased and similar risk ratios for the symptoms\nAccurate disease statuses; symptoms reported accurately by patients\nThe products of baseline incidence rates and risk ratios less than or equal to 1\nSimilar baseline correlations between symptoms among those diseased or not diseased\nEpidemiological measures of symptom occurrence in simulations\nPopulation sizes\n10,000\nNumber of symptoms that can be caused by the disease\nCorrelations between the disease that caused symptoms and the other associated disease that did not cause symptoms\n0, 0.3, and 0.7\nPrevalence rates or proportions of the population with the disease that caused symptoms\n0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8\nBaseline incidence rates of the symptoms, similar to all symptoms\n0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8\nRisk ratios of developing symptoms if diseased\n0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, and 25.0\nCorrelations between symptoms\n0, 0.4, and 0.8\nNumber of simulations for each combination of the above measures 3 to 7\nStatistics for assessment\nCorrelations between symptoms\nDiagnostic test accuracy (sensitivities, specificities, and AUCs) of the symptoms for the detection of the disease\nDiagnostic test accuracy (sensitivities, specificities, and AUCs) of the symptoms for the detection of the unrelated disease\nOpen in a new tab\narea under curve.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nElements of the simulations in this study.\nproportions diseased,\nincidence rate,\nrisk ratio.\nSimulation procedures\nThe R codes to simulate individuals with assumed epidemiological measures are in Appendix\n. For each simulation, we chose a combination of the above-mentioned epidemiological measures, including disease incidence, associations between diseases, and symptom risk ratios. In a simulation, we created 10,000 individuals and randomly assigned them disease statuses based on the assumed proportions diseased. We also randomly assigned the other associated disease based on its correlations with the main disease using an established method\n. The probability of individuals developing symptoms differed by whether they were diseased or not. Among those diseased, the probability of developing a symptom was the product of its baseline incidence and an assumed risk ratio. Among those not diseased, the probability of developing a symptom was based on the baseline incidence of the symptom, and we created 40 symptoms at the same time. We considered the correlations between the 40 symptoms, and we randomly assigned the symptoms based on disease statuses\nDiagnostic test accuracy of symptoms\nWe first described the diagnostic accuracy of the symptoms to detect the disease and the other associated disease using equations. Then we used the data obtained from simulations to validate the equations. We defined\nsensitivity\nas the number of true cases identified by a symptom or symptoms (more than the numbers required by a threshold) divided by the number of those diseased\n. We defined\nspecificity\nas the number of non-cases identified by the absence of a symptom or symptoms (using the same threshold as the sensitivity) divided by the number of those not diseased. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the 95% CIs were derived when using more than one symptom to detect the disease status\n. We compared the area under curves (AUCs) that were derived from using different numbers of symptoms for disease diagnosis\n. We chose the best set of sensitivity and specificity in a ROC curve by searching the set with the maximal difference between 1 and the sum of sensitivity and specificity in absolute values\n. We reported the number of symptoms and the sensitivity and specificity of the best set.\nApproximation of diagnostic accuracy and symptom correlations\nWe approximated the correlations between symptoms and diagnostic accuracy, including the sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis in simulated populations, with epidemiological measures using linear regression. Using linear regression models to approximate complicated measures has been proven to be an effective method to understand the role or importance of various factors on these measures. We considered correlations between symptoms or diagnostic accuracy to be a dependent variable (\n), and approximated them by using the above-mentioned epidemiological measures with or without their interaction terms (denoted as\nranging from 1 to the total number of independent variables in a regression model). The equation was\n, where\ndenoted the intercept,\ndenoted the regression coefficients, and\nWe used this approach to interpret principal components\n, determine life stages\n, interpret the diagnosis of frailty syndrome\n, and demonstrate the biases generated by the diagnostic criteria of mental illnesses\n. We conduced all the statistical analyses using the R environment (v3.5.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)\nand RStudio (v1.1.463, RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA)\nResults\nQuality of simulations and symptom incidence\nThe derived baseline incidence rates of single symptoms matched the assumed incidence rates, regardless of the assumed proportions diseased, assumed risk ratios, and assumed correlations between symptoms (Appendix\n). The derived risk ratios matched the assumed risk ratios when the at-risk incidence (incidence among those diseased) was less than 1 (Appendix\n). Figure\npresents the symptom incidence among all subjects. The overall symptom incidence depended on the proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence, and symptom risk ratios. Based on the similarities between the assumed and derived values, the simulations were well implemented.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nSymptom incidence depending on the baseline incidence, proportions diseased, and risk ratios.\nrisk ratios.\nCorrelations between symptoms\nThe correlations between the symptoms ranged from − 0.02 to 0.99 in all simulations (see Table\n). The effects of the assumed epidemiological measures on the correlations between symptoms in the linear regression models depended on whether the at-risk incidence reached 1. The correlations between the two diseases, one causing symptoms and the other only associated with the disease, were not significantly associated with the correlations between the symptoms. The at-risk incidence reaching 1 or not, proportions diseased, risk ratios, at-risk incidence, and symptom correlations among those not diseased (baseline symptom correlations) were significantly and positively associated with the overall symptom correlations. The baseline incidence was negatively and significantly associated with the overall symptom correlations. The adjusted R-squared was 0.86 and 0.89 with at-risk incidence reaching 1 or not, respectively.\nTable 4.\nEffects of baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on overall symptom correlations.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n− 0.007\n(− 0.008 to − 0.006)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(− 0.001 to 0.001)\nProportions diseased\n(0.117 to 0.121)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline incidence\n− 0.107\n(− 0.109 to − 0.105)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0.016 to 0.016)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n(0.183 to 0.187)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0.840 to 0.842)\n< 0.0001\nDependent variables mean = 0.5; SD = 0.31; median = 0.47; min = − 0.04; max = 0.99\nAdjusted R-square = 0.89\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(0.336 to 0.342)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(− 0.002 to 0.002)\nProportions diseased\n(0.312 to 0.318)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline incidence\n− 0.337\n(− 0.341 to − 0.333)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0.01 to 0.01)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0.637 to 0.641)\n< 0.0001\nDependent variables mean = 0.62; SD = 0.29; median = 0.72; min = − 0.02; max = 0.99\nAdjusted R-square = 0.86\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nDiagnostic test accuracy of individual symptoms for the detection of the diseases\nAs expected in Table\n, the sensitivities and specificities of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis can be predicted with at-risk incidence (Table\n) and 1 minus baseline incidence (Table\n), respectively. The sensitivities of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis were 1 for all symptoms, when the at-risk incidence reached 1. The effect sizes of disease correlations, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations remained the same, when the at-risk incidence reached 1 or not.\nTable 5.\nEffects of baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on the sensitivities of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\nBaseline incidence\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\nDependent variable mean = 0.64; SD = 0.32; median = 0.55; min = 0.12; max = 1\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\nBaseline incidence\n(0 to 0)\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\nDependent variable mean = 1; SD = 0; median = 1; min = 1; max = 1\nAdjusted R-square = 0.5\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nTable 6.\nEffects of baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on the specificities of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\nBaseline incidence\n(− 1 to − 1)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\nDependent variable mean = 0.62; SD = 0.27; median = 0.61; min = 0.17; max = 0.97\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\nBaseline incidence\n(− 1 to − 1)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\nDependent variable mean = 0.61; SD = 0.29; median = 0.63; min = 0.17; max = 0.97\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nDiagnostic test accuracy of symptom numbers for disease diagnosis\nWhen using the accumulative numbers of symptoms to predict the disease directly causing the symptoms, we used the AUCs to compare the diagnostic test accuracy across the numbers of symptoms used. Figure\nshows one example of the ROC curve assuming the risk ratio as 2, baseline symptom incidence as 0.1, proportions diseased as 0.05, no correlations between diseases, and no correlations between symptoms. When more symptoms were used for disease diagnosis, the AUCs increased. We selected the best set of sensitivities and specificities for disease diagnosis based on the sums of sensitivities and specificities (red dots in Fig.\n). The red dots also represent the diagnostic thresholds for disease diagnosis. For example, when using 40 symptoms for disease diagnosis, the threshold of obtaining the best set of sensitivities and specificities was 5.5 (see the red dots in Fig.\n). This result suggested that when there were 6 or more symptoms out of 40 presenting in individual patients, the sensitivity to detect the disease cause was 86.3%. The specificity for correctly excluding the disease in individuals with less than 6 symptoms out of 40 was 79.4%. For other combinations of epidemiologic measures, see examples in Appendix\nFigure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for disease diagnosis based on the numbers of symptoms. Red dots = the set of sensitivities and specificities with the largest difference in the absolute values between 1 and the sums of sensitivities and specificities in a ROC curve. For each number of symptoms used for disease diagnosis, one red dot—a best set of sensitivities and specificities—was selected. With a maximum of 40 symptoms used for disease diagnosis, ROC curves in this figure were created assuming the risk ratio as 2, baseline symptom incidence as 0.1, proportions diseased as 0.05, no correlations between diseases, and no correlations between symptoms.\nshows the effects of epidemiological measures on the AUCs of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis. The AUCs of individual symptoms can be explained fully by disease correlations, proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence, risk ratios, at-risk symptom incidence, and symptom correlations (adjusted R-squared = 1 for at-risk incidence reaching 1 or not). When the at-risk incidence was less than 1, the at-risk incidence and baseline incidence had the same effect sizes of opposite directions, a regression coefficient of 0.5 and − 0.5, respectively. When the at-risk incidence reached 1, the AUCs of individual symptoms decreased with the baseline symptom incidence (regression coefficient = − 0.5) from 1 (perfect diagnostic accuracy).\nTable 7.\nEffects of baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of individual symptoms for disease diagnosis.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(0.5 to 0.5)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\nBaseline incidence\n(− 0.5 to − 0.5)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n(0.5 to 0.5)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\nDependent variable mean = 0.63; SD = 0.27; median = 0.6; min = 0.27; max = 0.98\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(1 to 1)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0 to 0)\nProportions diseased\n(0 to 0)\nBaseline incidence\n(− 0.5 to − 0.5)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n(0 to 0)\nDependent variable mean = 0.8; SD = 0.15; median = 0.8; min = 0.59; max = 0.98\nAdjusted R-square = 1\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nIn Table\n, using a maximum of 40 symptoms for disease diagnosis, we analyzed the effects of the epidemiological measures on the observed maximal AUCs.

The correlations between diseases were not significant (\n> 0.68 for both). Proportions diseased were significantly and positively associated with the maximal AUCs (\n< 0.05 for all). Baseline symptom incidence and symptom correlations were significantly and negatively associated with the maximal AUCs (\n< 0.05 for all).

When the at-risk incidence reached 1, the correlations between the diseases and their interaction terms with the baseline symptom incidence, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations remained significantly associated with the AUCs to predict the associated disease (\n< 0.0001 for all). The proportions of the AUC variances explained by the epidemiological measures depended on whether the at-risk incidence reached 1 or not, adjusted R-squared = 0.96 and 0.66, respectively.\nTable 11.\nEffects of the correlations between diseases, baseline incidence, proportions diseased, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations on the areas under curves obtained from the maximal area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using at most 40 symptoms to predict the disease associated with the disease that caused symptoms.\nCoefficients\n(95% CIs)\nIncidence not reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(0.453 to 0.471)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0.187 to 0.229)\n< 0.0001\nProportions diseased\n− 0.002\n(− 0.013 to 0.009)\nBaseline incidence\n− 0.195\n(− 0.21 to − 0.18)\n< 0.0001\nRisk ratio\n− 0.014\n(− 0.015 to − 0.013)\n< 0.0001\nAt-risk incidence\n(0.254 to 0.27)\n< 0.0001\nBaseline symptom correlation\n− 0.005\n(− 0.014 to 0.004)\nCorrelation between diseases:Proportions diseased\n(− 0.016 to 0.034)\nCorrelation between diseases:Baseline incidence\n− 0.197\n(− 0.228 to − 0.166)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases:Risk ratio\n(0.025 to 0.029)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases:Baseline symptom correlation\n− 0.094\n(− 0.116 to − 0.072)\n< 0.0001\nDependent variable mean = 0.57; SD = 0.14; median = 0.51; min = 0.13; max = 0.88\nAdjusted R-square = 0.66\nIncidence reaching 1 among those diseased\n(Intercept)\n(0.502 to 0.514)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases\n(0.604 to 0.632)\n< 0.0001\nProportions diseased\n− 0.007\n(− 0.013 to − 0.001)\nBaseline incidence\n(− 0.008 to 0.008)\nRisk ratio\n(0 to 0)\nBaseline symptom correlation\n− 0.003\n(− 0.008 to 0.002)\nCorrelation between diseases:Proportions diseased\n(− 0.011 to 0.015)\nCorrelation between diseases:Baseline incidence\n− 0.254\n(− 0.273 to − 0.235)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases:Risk ratio\n− 0.002\n(− 0.003 to − 0.001)\n< 0.0001\nCorrelation between diseases:Baseline symptom correlation\n− 0.182\n(− 0.193 to − 0.171)\n< 0.0001\nDependent variable mean = 0.65; SD = 0.13; median = 0.64; min = 0.47; max = 0.88\nAdjusted R-square = 0.96\nOpen in a new tab\nconfidence interval,\nstandard deviation.\nObserved symptom correlations and incidence on the AUCs\nIn Table\n, the AUCs to predict the disease directly causing symptoms were approximated with observable measures: overall symptom correlations, overall symptom incidence, and numbers of symptoms used for disease diagnosis.

When single symptoms are caused by a common disease and used to predict disease status, the sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms can be predicted fully with the at-risk incidence and 1 minus baseline symptom incidence, respectively. This can be proved by mathematical equations or observed in simulations. However, when two or more symptoms of the same disease cause are used to estimate disease status, the estimates of the joint incidence rates, joint risk ratios, and joint at-risk incidence are required in the equations describing these multiple symptoms. Therefore, it becomes complicated to derive diagnostic accuracy in mathematical equations, and so it is practical to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of multiple symptoms through simulations. Key epidemiological measures for symptom development were identified in the equations: proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence, and risk ratios of symptom development. The correlations between symptoms are important when more than one symptom are used for disease diagnosis. A combination of these epidemiological measures of the symptoms can be used to simulate symptom development according to disease status. When at most two symptoms occur in a population, the diagnostic accuracy—sensitivities and specificities—of having 0, 1, and 2 symptoms can be derived to construct a ROC and its AUC. By repeating this process until 40 symptoms are used, the AUCs increase or decrease or remain around 0.5 when risk ratios are greater than 1, less than 1, or equals 1, respectively. For a combination of the epidemiological measures, the maximal AUCs can be selected from the simulations. We selected the best sets of sensitivities and specificities whose absolute values had the largest differences between their sums and 1, for a given AUC. The trade-off between sensitivities and specificities can be observed\n, when more symptoms are used for disease diagnosis.\nFor a combination of epidemiological measures, AUCs tend to reach the plateau with less than 30 symptoms, particularly when baseline symptom correlations are closer to 0, i.e., symptoms are not statistically correlated. The maximal AUCs can be well approximated with baseline incidence, risk ratios, at-risk incidence, and baseline symptom correlations (adjusted R-squared > 0.71). The best sets of sensitivities and specificities also can be well approximated with these measures (adjusted R-squared > 0.69). However, in the real world, symptom incidence and risk ratios cannot be determined when the disease status cannot be precisely confirmed. We found that the three observable measures—overall symptom correlations, overall symptom incidence, and numbers of symptoms—do not well explain the AUC variances (adjusted R-squared = 0.03). When researchers are confident that the RRs are greater than 1 (AUCs increase with the numbers of symptoms), the observable measures explain the AUC variances even worse (adjusted R-squared = 0.02).\nEvidence-based recommendations?\nA previous study has provided several recommendations for how to use age-related symptoms to diagnose a geriatric syndrome, frailty\n. The first recommendation for using symptoms for frailty diagnosis was to explicitly select these symptoms based on their associations with health status\n. The authors did not provide recommendations about selecting symptoms directly associated with frailty\n. The second recommendation was to choose symptoms that become more prevalent with age\n. The third recommendation was to choose symptoms that do not saturate early in the life stage (do not become very prevalent among the elderly)\n. The fourth recommendation was to include symptoms developed from different systems\n, for example, not to include only symptoms related to changes in cognition\n. The last recommendation was to use the same frailty indices consisting of the same symptoms, when the indices are used in the same populations in different time points\n. The authors thought different frailty indices often yield similar results in the same samples\nOne additional recommendation was to use at least 30 to 40 symptoms to create frailty indices, since they claimed that using more symptoms leads to more precise estimates\nNo scientific evidence exists to support the first three above-mentioned recommendations\n. In fact, these three recommendations are likely to contradict our findings. When symptoms were used to predict a disease not directly associated with them in our simulations, the diagnostic accuracy of the symptoms for the associated disease partly depended on the correlations between the associated disease and the disease that directly caused symptoms (Table\n). When health-related symptoms are chosen based on health status and used to predict frailty, the correlations between health status and frailty should be well determined to understand their role in the diagnostic accuracy of the health-related symptoms for frailty. The first recommendation failed to recognize that the diagnostic accuracy of the health-related symptoms for frailty diagnosis depends on the correlations between health status and frailty and their interaction terms with baseline symptom incidence, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations.\nThe second and third recommendations require the symptoms to also be associated with age\n. In addition to being caused by frailty in theory, the symptoms used to predict frailty are required to be associated with both health status and age. This approach creates a causal network that is difficult to simulate due to the large number of epidemiological measures involved, including the associations between age, health status, and frailty (3 parameters), how they interact with the baseline incidence and risk ratios of symptoms (3 X 2 parameters), and many others. This complexity is beyond what our simulations could handle and thus further evidence to justify these recommendations would be required. However, to our knowledge, no clear evidence exists to support the hypothesized casual network associated with these two recommendations.\nThe second and third recommendations also impose limits on the prevalence of the symptoms for frailty diagnosis\n. The prevalence of frailty symptoms could not be too low because they need to increase with age according to the second recommendation\n. Frailty symptoms could not be too common so that they would not saturate early\n. In our simulations, overall symptom incidence failed to explain a large proportion of AUC variances, and was, in fact, negatively associated with diagnostic accuracy, AUCs. When baseline symptom incidence (among those not diseased only) can be estimated, it is negatively associated with the specificities of individual symptoms. We do not have sufficient evidence to support the recommendations to select frailty symptoms based on overall symptom prevalence.\nOur findings partly address the fourth recommendation that encourages using symptoms from various human systems. Baseline symptom correlations (among those not diseased) are significantly and negatively associated with the maximal AUCs, when the at-risk incidence among those diseased reached 1 or not. This recommendation may make better sense, particularly when symptoms from various human systems are less correlated. In the simulations, overall symptom correlations that are observable are significantly and positively associated with AUCs, though slightly. It is unclear whether the ranges of correlations that the recommendation authors aimed to suggest and this recommendation can be improved based on our findings.\nThe additional recommendation that encourages using more symptoms (at least 30) for disease diagnosis is not supported by any evidence\n. Our simulations show that diagnostic accuracy measured with AUCs often reaches a plateau at 30 or fewer symptoms. Moreover, the frailty indices produced by the authors of the recommendations being discussed have been criticized for using an excessive number of symptoms\n. Their frailty indices seem overcomplicated and can be simplified with fewer symptoms, because many of the input symptoms are correlated\nImplications for the use of diagnostic criteria\nCurrently the diagnosis of many conditions, such as mental illnesses\nand frailty indices\n, are based on composite diagnostic criteria. Both mental illnesses and frailty indices use symptoms to confirm diagnoses\n. However, recently several issues related to composite diagnostic criteria have been identified. The most important issue is that complicated diagnostic criteria introduce biases into the diagnoses\n. The input symptoms often are summed and censored with certain thresholds to derive intermediate variables or confirm diagnoses\n. When the numbers or sum of symptoms are censored, biases that are not explained by the input symptoms can be generated and introduced to the diagnoses\n. Therefore, the diagnoses of frailty have poor relationships with the input symptoms and do not predict major outcomes better than their input symptoms\n. When tested in trials, the use of the diagnoses of poor interpretability, such as frailty, is associated with early termination of trials\nBased on the findings in the present study, several approaches can be used to improve current diagnostic strategies. First, under certain circumstances, single symptoms may achieve high sensitivity or specificity. To effectively detect the disease, single symptoms need to be rare among those not diseased (a low baseline incidence and thus a high specificity) and have high risk ratios of development due to the disease cause (high sensitivity). However, the baseline incidence and risk ratios of the symptoms used to diagnose several conditions, such as frailty\nor mental illnesses\n, have not been well demonstrated.\nSecond, symptoms should be selected based on evidence, at least on the understanding of possible causes of the symptoms, estimated risk ratios, baseline symptom incidence, and baseline symptom correlations. We noticed that when the risk ratios were similar to 1, the maximal AUCs were around 0.5, and so the AUCs provided little diagnostic values. When the risk ratios were less than 1, suggesting that the presenting symptoms were less likely to be related to the disease, the AUCs were likely to be less than 0.5. When the risk ratios were greater than 1, the AUCs tended to exceed 0.5. When using less than 30 symptoms for disease diagnosis, the AUCs can often reach plateau levels. Epidemiological measures have different impacts on the sensitivities and specificities obtained from the maximal or minimal AUCs using at most 40 symptoms, and assuming risk ratios greater or less than 1, respectively.\nThird, when the relationships between symptoms have been well explored, using the number of symptoms for disease diagnosis can effectively minimize the biases introduced by data censoring\n. The biases induced by data censoring or categorization can lead to a diagnosis, of which more than 70% of its variances can be explained by biases alone\nFourth, using more symptoms for diagnosis increases complexity. In the present study, when we used more symptoms for diagnosis, we found that their diagnostic accuracy could be improved according to AUCs. However, selecting single symptoms with a high diagnostic accuracy is much preferred because using multiple symptoms requires complex design, depends on well-tested thresholds, and needs to be justified with extensive research on these symptoms and their interactions.\nFifth, baseline symptom correlations are associated with the diagnostic accuracy (AUC) plateau that the symptoms can reach. The differences in the diagnostic accuracy of single symptoms and multiple symptoms are larger when the baseline symptom correlations are closer to 0. It is highly recommended that diagnoses consider the correlations between the symptoms among those diseased or not. Last, in the real world, when the disease cause remains to be investigated, it is not likely to achieve a perfect estimate of baseline symptom incidence or risk ratios, or to confirm baseline symptom correlations among those not diseased. In our simulations, overall symptom correlations, overall symptom incidence, and numbers of symptoms were observable and can be easily obtained. If the risk ratios cannot be estimated at all, symptom correlations and numbers of symptoms are positively and significantly associated with the AUCs for disease diagnosis. The overall symptom incidence is negatively and significantly associated with the AUCs. The three observable measures only explain a small fraction of the variances of the AUCs for disease diagnosis (adjusted R-squared = 0.03). When researchers are confident that these symptoms are more likely to occur among those diseased (RR > 1), these three measures remain significant, although the fraction of the variances of the AUCs for disease diagnosis further decreases (adjusted R-squared = 0.02).\nFuture research directions\nSeveral directions are open for future research. First, continuous variables can be used for disease diagnosis, which will require the development of complicated mathematical equations and add complexity to simulation and modeling. We will use the number of symptoms as the template for continuous-variable simulations. Second, often, more than one disease can cause the same symptoms, which adds quite a few interaction terms to the epidemiological measures. When established, these models will provide valuable examples to real-world studies. Third, models that build on incremental improvement will be necessary. It is computationally impossible to implement all models to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of the symptoms that occurred based on the epidemiological measures of all possible values. However, it is relatively feasible to construct simulations that conform to well-studied association networks\nand epidemiological measures reasonably estimated with real-world data. Simulations can be used to support the findings from real world data, and may provide lessons for causal inference. In future studies, we will implement more complicated simulations and explore the usefulness of simulations for causal inference.\nLastly, situations exist that involve more complicated diagnostic approaches, for example clinical case definitions used in outbreak investigations\n. Case definitions may be applicable to patients experiencing symptoms or signs in certain times or places, depending on the diseases of interest\n. For example, a clinical malaria case can be defined based on the presence of the pathogen in the blood and the occurrence of related symptoms within 2 days of examination\n. These case definitions can be modified to suit outbreak investigations and settings\n. Our findings help to demonstrate the key epidemiological parameters that researchers need to pay attention to when they aim to update case definitions. In an outbreak investigation, the information on these epidemiological measures should be systematically collected. We think it possible to improve case definitions using updated information on these measures. This finding needs to be studied further in the future.\nLimitations\nOur simulation study depended on various assumptions: one disease causing multiple symptoms, similar symptom incidence, similar risk ratios causing symptoms, and similar correlations between symptoms among those not diseased. A related disease was set up to occur in association with the symptom-causing disease. This related disease remains insignificant in the symptoms’ diagnostic accuracy for disease diagnosis (AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities). However, the simulations are not likely to match the complex multi-cause examples commonly seen in the real world. For example, the symptoms of frailty, a geriatric syndrome, can be linked to frailty and many other causes\n. Due to computational constraints, a limited number of the values of the epidemiological measures were simulated. These epidemiological measures have many other values that need to be tested. Assuming the epidemiological measures have similar levels across symptoms, variations are due to the random assignment to different simulated populations. These variations may lead to slight differences in the simulation results.\nConclusion\nAssuming symptoms are caused by a single disease, they occur based on four epidemiological measures: proportions diseased, baseline symptom incidence, risk ratios, and baseline symptom correlations. The symptom incidence among those diseased, at-risk incidence, can reach a maximum of 1. The sensitivities and specificities of single symptoms for disease diagnosis can be fully predicted by at-risk incidence and 1 minus baseline incidence, respectively. When the disease causes multiple symptoms based on similar epidemiological measures, these symptoms can be used for disease diagnosis. Using two symptoms for disease diagnosis—for example, the sensitivities and specificities of having 0, 1, or 2 symptoms—can be calculated to draw a ROC and derive its AUC. When repeating the same procedures using 1 to 40 symptoms for disease diagnosis, the maximal AUCs can be obtained, and the best sets of sensitivities and specificities can be selected from them. The above-mentioned epidemiological measures can explain large fractions of the maximal AUCs and the best sets of sensitivities and specificities. These findings are important for researchers who want to assess composite diagnostic criteria that are subject to biases and lack an evidence base. For example, the recommendations on constructing a frailty index have been widely used\n. However, these recommendations neglect the role of these epidemiological measures and focus on observable measures (overall symptom incidence and numbers of symptoms) that do not well explain symptom diagnostic accuracy.\nSupplementary Information\nSupplementary Information.\n(2.7MB, docx)\nAuthor contributions\nY.S.C. conceptualized and designed this study, managed and analyzed data, and drafted the manuscript.

(Vrikshayurveda). Medicinal Plants form the\nmajor resource base of our indigenous healthcare traditions. Although in recent years cultivation of\nmedicinal plants has started gaining momentum, still a significant part of our requirements continue\nto be met from wild sources. In order to meet increasing demand for medicinal plants both domestic\nand from overseas markets we need to focus on both ex-situ cultivation of medicinal plants as well\nas in-situ conservation efforts through systematic surveys, augmenting local medicinal plants and\naromatic species of medicinal significance through afforestation as per silvicultural principles and\nmanagement prescriptions. With this in mind the “Central Sector Scheme for Conservation,\nDevelopment and Sustainable Management of Medicinal Plants” was initially approved by the\ncabinet vide no. CCEA/21/2008 dated 26.06.2008. The scheme was approved with an outlay of Rs.\n450.00 crores for XIIth Plan period in the EFC meeting held on 01-12-2014 and continued till\n31stMarch, 2021. The Central Sector Scheme for Conservation, Development and Sustainable\nManagement of Medicinal Plants has been further approved for continuation beyond 31st March,\n2021 with an outlay of Rs. 322.41 Crores for a period of five years from 2021-22 to 2025-26 in\nthe SFC meeting held on 17th March, 2021\nThe scheme also focusses on quality R&D, capacity building through trainings, raising\nawareness through promotional activities like creation of Home/School Herbal Gardens. The\nscheme also seeks to support programs for quality assurance and standardization through\ndevelopment of Good Agriculture and Collection Practices (GACPs); development of monographs\nlaying down standards of quality, safety and efficacy; development of agro-techniques and a\ncredible institution a mechanism for certification of quality of raw drugs, seeds and planting\nmaterial. Apart from this, medicinal plants collection and trade accounts for as much as 40 to 50%\nof the household income in certain forest rich regions, hence, the scheme also aims at livelihood\nimprovement of local communities, especially in forest fringe areas.\nThe activities proposed to be undertaken in the scheme will also help the country to meet\nits international obligations in the field of medicinal plant's biodiversity and promoting bilateral /\ninternational cooperation which is not only critical for future growth of the sector but also for\nestablishing India as a global leader in the sector.\nObjectives of the Scheme:\nThe efforts of the National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) need to be considerably upscaled\nstrategy needs to focus on both cultivation and collection, together with R&D, promotion and\ninformation dissemination through IT dedicated mechanisms for procurement of Medicinal and\nAromatic Plants (MAPs), ensuring Minimum Support Price, setting up networked Agri-Mandis for\nMAPs, drawing up a database of cultivators and growers / cooperatives. Speciality warehousing &\nstrengthening of the supply chain is another priority area. In order to cater to the domestic market\nneeds of Ayurveda, Siddha & Unani (ASU) industries, promotion of Primary Producer Companies\n(PPCs) should be taken-up in a focused manner. These organizations would then be brought into\nthe foreground for marketing of their produce (either cultivated or collected from wild). The most\nimportant aspect is of-course capacity building of all the stake-holders especially the collectors\nwho constitute the poorest of the poor of society\nThe main objectives of the scheme are as follows:\n Promote in-situ and / or ex-situ Conservation, Resource Augmentation of medicinal plants\nwhich are important to the AYUSH Industry and Folk Medicine.\nIn situ conservation measures would involve survey, inventorisation and documentation\nof important medicinal plants in their native/natural habitat coupled with resource\naugmentation in eco-systems where they form part of the naturally occurring biotic\ncommunity, preventing degradation of such eco-systems in a holistic manner and\nreversing the onslaught of invasive alien weeds;\n Promote ex-situ conservation by supporting such programs in rural / degraded forest /\npublic / non-public / institutional lands / urban & peri-urban lands and waste lands.\n Engage the Eco-Task Force mechanism for reversing habitat degradation of medicinal\nplants. Conservation & development of eco-systems with medicinal plants bio-diversity.\n Promote R&D in all aspects of medicinal plants, development of agro-techniques, post-\nharvest management, storage and processing, developing molecular characterization\ntools etc.\n Enhance livelihood systems based on medicinal plants for farmers, collectors and other\nstakeholders.\n Ensure Quality Assurance, Maintain Good Quality Gene Pool Sources of medicinal plants\nand aromatic plants having medicinal applications. Mapping, upgrading, modernizing of\nMedicinal Plants supply chain and creating/ optimizing market linkages and value addition.\n Quality standardization, Good Collection Practices and Good Agricultural Practices for\nMedicinal Plants.\nInformation, Education and Communication - through seminars, trainings and exposure\nvisits promote capacity building and human resource development through appropriate\ninter-state and international exposure. Promote publication of documents, monographs,\ntechnical bulletins, documentaries, brochures, posters, other publicity materials, etc.\n Take steps to meet India’s international obligations in the context of medicinal plant\nbiodiversity and promote bilateral / international cooperation.\n Strengthen NMPB so as to more efficiently co-ordinate all matters related to medicinal\nplants and function as a clearinghouse of information on medicinal plants including their\noccurrence, usage, ethno-botanical uses, cultivation practices, Post - harvest practices,\nmarkets etc. Institutional Strengthening of SMPBs and creating regional centres to\noptimize the strategic reach of the AYUSH systems.\n Promote mainstreaming of medicinal plants in climate change mitigation strategies &\npromote regeneration / afforestation of medicinal plant tree species towards carbon\nsequesterisation.\n Take steps to meet India's international obligations in the context of medicinal plant\nbiodiversity and promote bilateral/international cooperation.\nSTRATEGY\nThe scheme is proposed to be implemented during 2021-22 to 2025-26 to facilitate conservation\nand post-harvest management of Medicinal Plants for long term sustainability by adopting the\nfollowing strategy:-\na) Medicinal Plant Conservation Areas (MPCAs) by systematic survey, geo referencing of\nexisting natural population of medicinal and native aromatic species having medicinal use.\nb) Enhance conservation through in-situ and ex-situ resource augmentation and artificial re-\ngeneration of local populations of medicinal and aromatic plant species.\nc) Expand area under medicinal and aromatic plants species of medicinal values linked with\ncreation of nurseries to maintain good quality propagation material.\nd) Promote R & D to address the technology gaps particularly with respect to quality,\ndocumentation, identification of substitutes for important medicinal plants including Rare\nEndangered & Threatened (RET) listed plants and species with high demand in trade and\nbio-activity guided phyto-chemical studies, etc.\ne) Improve production, post-harvest technologies, and certification mechanisms for quality\nstandards, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Field Collection Practices (GFCP) and\nGood Storage Practices (GSP) value addition and marketing infrastructure.\nquality assurance of medicinal plants.\ng) Provide livelihoods and economic benefit to forest dwellers, cultivators, local healers and\nother stakeholders.\nNational Medicinal Plants Board\nThe Medicinal Plants Board was setup under a Government Resolution notified on 24th November\n2000. The objective of establishing a Board was to establish an agency which would be responsible\nfor coordination of all matters relating to medicinal plants. The Board has the function of coordinating\nwith Ministries / Department/Organizations /State/UT Governments for development of medicinal\nplants in general and specifically in the following fields:\n Assessment of demand / supply position relating to medicinal plants both within the country\n& abroad.\n Advise the concerned Ministries/ Department/ Organizations/ States/ UTs Governments\non policy matters relating to schemes and programs for development of medicinal plants.\n Provide guidance in the formulation of proposals, schemes and programs etc. to be taken\nby agencies having access to land for cultivation and infrastructure for collection, storage\ntransportation of medicinal plants.\nIdentification, inventorization and quantification of medicinal plants.\n Promotion of ex-situ and in-situ conservation and Resource Augmentation of medicinal\nplants.\n Promotion of co-operative effort among collectors and growers and assisting them to\nstore, transport and market their products respectively.\n Setting up of data base on medicinal plants, dissemination of information and facilitating\nprevention of patents on plants used in traditional systems.\n Matter relating to import/export of raw material, as well as value added products either as\nmedicine, food supplements or as herbal cosmetics including adoption of better techniques\nfor marketing of products to increase their reputation for quality and reliability in the country\nand abroad.\n Undertaking and awarding Scientific, Technological research and cost-effectiveness\nstudies.\n Development of protocols for cultivation and control.\n Encouraging the protection of Patent Rights and IPR.\nI.

The eligible organization can apply directly to\nNMPB online in the relevant proforma where the proposal will go through scrutiny by the Project\nScreening Committee (PSC) before being considered for approval by SFC. Prior to placing before\nthe PSC, wherever appropriate the research proposal can first be referred to subject expert by\nNMPB for taking expert's opinion on quality of the proposals. For such scrutiny a fee as approved\nManagement Support\nOne project management Consultant along with Office Assistant / Data Entry Operator will be\nengaged for providing support at NMPB level for activities relating to scrutiny, implementation,\nmonitoring and technical support to the state.\n2.2 Quality Assurance\nObjectives\nToday globally companies are looking for traceability of raw materials to their source, as it is\nobvious that the quality of the end product can only be as good as the quality of the components\nthat go into that product. Hence the importance of maintaining good standards while collecting,\ncultivating and post-harvest handling of the raw material cannot be over emphasized.\n2.2.1 Promotion of Good Practices\n For India to become a global hub in medicinal plants processing, we need to list out the\nchallenges faced by the sector. One of the most important stakeholders is the group of\nintermediaries who are a very important part of the supply chain from collectors / cultivators\nto the end users of the raw material. These inter mediaries are largely in the private sector\nand deal with bulk handling of raw material from procurement to storage and sale in the\nmandies. This is the stage at which there are maximum chances of contamination of the raw\nmaterial, due to lack of general hygiene. Elimination of such sources of contamination is\nimperative for tackling the issues of microbial overload in herbal products. In order to do\nso, extensive capacity building of the intermediaries is required. There is a need to create\nawareness about maintenance of high standards of hygiene amongst collectors,\ncultivators, other raw material handlers and traders. This capacity building should be an\non-going process through a series of stakeholder meetings, workshops, seminars etc. A\nstrategy will be initiated for registration/devising regulation of important intermediaries in\nthe Market Supply Chain of medicinal plants. This will be done by providing support in a\nproject mode, to appropriate agencies.\nIn addition to this, we need to evolve norms for proper handling of raw material i.e. what\nconstitutes good practice as far as raw drug handling is concerned. Also there needs to\nbe in place a system of self-regulation through peer groups in mandies. Consultancies\nstudies will be commissioned for this purpose. This will also be addressed through\nfocussed projects through SFC approval.\n Presently testing is by and large limited to the finished products. Industry has always held\nthat in the absence of supply of contamination free raw material, it is not fair to expect the\nproducts to stand up to rigorous testing. Hence, maintaining a chain of practices to ensure\ngood quality of raw material will create a win-win situation for the producers / traders on\nthe one hand by ensuring better prices and the manufacturers on the other by ensuring\ngreater market access. This will also be supported in a consultancy / project mode.\nIn order, to more effectively address the above challenges the following measures will also be taken\nin project / consultancy mode:\na) Development of agro-techniques of selected medicinal plants.\nb) Protection of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Field Collection Practices\n(GFCP), Good Harvesting Practices (GHP) & Post Harvesting Practices, Good Storage\nPractices (GSP). The work done by Quality Council of India (QCI) for GAP &GFCP in the\n11thPlan will be taken forward towards actual field implementation in project mode.\nc) Support to testing laboratories, reimbursement of testing charges to stakeholders.\nd) Development of certification protocols for sustainable harvesting of seeds, planting\nmaterials and raw drugs from the wild in project mode.\ne) Other measures for Quality certification programmes as necessary.\n2.2.2 Raw Drug Repositories\nAnother important aspect of quality is the true botanical identity of the herb. To ensure proper\nidentity, there is a need to establish multiple Raw Drug Repositories (RDR), which can supply\ncertified samples of Indian medicinal plants on cost basis, to act as Reference Standards.\nPhytochemical Reference Standards (PRS) are required for assay purposes. There is a need to\ncreate a mechanism in India for consistent supply / sale of PRS required by various Pharmacopoeias\nfor quality assessment of Indian medicinal plants.\nFor this purpose, it is essential to establish multiple Raw Drug Repositories, in different areas of\nthe country. Each RDR could be encouraged to develop proficiency / core competence, in a few\nof the above listed scientific areas.\nThe RDR's should ideally work on development of \"Key Distinguishing Characters\" (KDC) for Indian\nmedicinal plants so that they can be distinguished from their look alike / adulterants. Some of the\ntechniques are:\n Pharmacognosy parameters like Macroscopy (organoleptic characters)\n Microscopy (Anatomy and powder microscopy), TLC, HPLC etc.\n DNA barcoding and fingerprinting\n Detection of characteristic / marker compounds\n Fingerprinting using new techniques like LC-MS-MS and NMR profile etc.\nNorms of Assistance\nFor national repository of raw drugs / BRS total assistance admissible is Rs.10.00 crores, while\nfor regional raw drug repositories it is Rs. 5.00 crores each to Govt. Organizations.\nStakeholders through Information Education and Communication (IEC) strategy:\nAwareness Building, Exposure Visits, Education and Capacity Building of\nMedicinal plant sector involves an array of stakeholders varying from resource managers,\ncultivators, gatherers, supply chain intermediaries, traders, local healers, researchers to\nmanufactures and exporters. It is necessary to disseminate information on different aspects of\nmedicinal plants like harvesting from wild, cultivation technologies, manufacturing, proper\nhandling of raw material, trade, etc. among various target groups about the importance of\ndevelopment and management through an appropriate outreach strategy, Capacity building,\nappropriate recognition, incentivisation etc.\nActivities\n Publicity through regular participation in Exhibitions/Fairs\n Aushadhi Vanaspati Mitra Program (AVMP)\n Organizing Workshops / Seminars / Conferences / Arogya Fair etc.\n Medicinal Plant Species specific/Campaigns\n Systematic use of Multimedia and other appropriate communication tools.\n Setting up and operation of Web Portal.\n Training and Capacity Building initiatives.\n3.1. Participation in Exhibition / Fairs and Publicity Materials\nTo promote the message of Indian Medicinal Plants it is essential to participate in International /\nNational / State Level Exhibitions / Fairs associating all important stake holder groups in the\ncountry. Besides, Trade fairs or Medicinal Plants Expo, etc. may also be supported or organized\nby NMPB, to raise awareness on the importance of medicinal plants among the stakeholders and\ngeneral public.\nActivities\n Participation in Exhibitions / Fairs with a focus on botanicals at State, National and\nInternational level. Industry and other stakeholders will be encouraged to participate in such\nexpos.

Other Interventions\n6.1 Bilateral / International cooperation and collaboration with International Agencies\nMinistry of AYUSH is exploring bilateral and international collaboration in the field of medicinal\nplants with other countries. MOUs for bilateral Collaboration in the field of medicinal plants has\nalready been developed for NMPB which could be appropriately fine-tuned for country specific\nneeds for collaboration requirements. In addition, Collaboration will be explored with international\nagencies like FAO, World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), UNDP, TRAFFIC, GEF, etc.\nfor mainstreaming of medicinal plant development strategies.\nThe traditional knowledge based on genetic resources needs to be brought under international\nbest practices on TK & GRs like Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS), Prior Informed Consent (PIC),\netc. There are international agreements and protocols to deal with all of these issues, which are\nconstantly evolving and we need to, not only keep abreast of all such developments but also get\nthem tailored to suit India's interest provided we are in a position to put forth our point of view at\nthe correct time. It is evident that the National Medicinal Plant Board (NMPB) should have a\ndedicated mechanism to carry out requisite spadework to enable it to forge linkages with likeminded\ncountries and render meaningful inputs to argue our case at the relevant international forums, like\nthe meetings of the Conference of Parties (CoPs) of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD)\nespecially the current discussions on the ongoing program of work, access and benefit sharing\nissues under the Nagoya Protocol, trans-boundary issues under the Cartagena Protocol on\nbiosafety etc.\nActivities\n Participation in meetings of the relevant agencies at the international level.\n Exchange visits of experts with countries of interest especially those having similar\nbiogeography as India.\n Participation in reputed international seminars/exhibitions on botanicals such as Ingredients\nRussia, Food ingredient China, Vita Foods South America, Canadian Health Food\nAssociation, International Food Ingredients and Additives (IFIA), Japan, Supply Side West,\nCPHI, World Wide. A list of important events will be drawn up after the approval by the SFC.\nThis would also entail subsidizing industry desirous of such participation on reimbursement\nbasis.\n Setting up information centers on medicinal plants in Indian Missions abroad.\n Providing financial assistance for acquiring international certification.\n Subsidizing specific market promoting activities like product registrations, GRAS\n(Generally Recognized as Safe) affirmation, international certifications, positive listing of\nIndian botanicals in the importing countries (viz. ARTG of TGA) etc.\n Resolving issues of botanical ingredients which have been illogically banned by some\ninternational regulatory bodies.\n Commissioning studies on international regulations in the medicinal plants sector as\nknowledge about this is scarce at present.\nEligibility\nProposals from Industry and reputed agencies having experience in international regulation on\nmedicinal plants will be considered in project mode for commissioning studies.\nNorms of Assistance\nExpenditure incurred by the Industry organizations for participation in international exhibitions/ fairs\netc. would be reimbursed subject to prior permission being obtained from NMPB for participation\nby the concerned organization. Reimbursable items of expenditure would include, hire charges,\nstalls fabrication, developing publicity material, travel and accommodation. Reimbursement would\nbe limited to 50% of the expenditure of Rs.3.00 lakhs whichever is less. Other activities will be\nsupported in project mode with 100% assistance to Public Sector and 50% of the project cost to\nthe private sector. NMPB can also lead delegations / participate in these events.\n(a) Setting up of information centres in Indian Missions abroad\nInformation Centres for Medicinal Plants are a good way to create awareness of Indian\nmedicinal plants. The extent of financial support for this purpose will be determined on country-\nbasis on the recommendation of the concerned Indian Embassy, as per actual financial\nimplication.\nThe proposals in project mode formulated by NMPB will be examined and approved by SFC.\n(b) Commissioning studies on Specific aspects of medicinal plants\nObjectives\nTo keep pace with the increasing trend in demand for medicinal plants' raw materials, it is\nnecessary to 'periodically update the information on various aspects like production, collection,\nsupply & marketing. Such updating will be done by commissioning subject specific studies from\ntime to time Support for collection of statistical information related with various aspects of\nmedicinal plants may be provided to SMPB or other agencies identified having competence in this\narea by NMPB or the States.\nMajor areas of studies\nAn illustrative list of themes is as below:-\n Developing a data base of National and Regional Traders of medicinal plants and initiate\nwork towards their registrations.\n Developing a data base of Farmers / Cultivators.\n Demand and Supply of Medicinal Plants\n Livelihood / yield studies\n Supply Chain Mapping\n Rationalization of Transit Pass system\n Consolidation of Yield\n Whole sale Price Data\n Developing case studies and success stories\nSuch studies would be awarded as per GFR provisions.\nNorms for assistance\nProject based proposals will be considered by PSC/SFC.\n6.2. Marketing\nMarket Information Services are characterized by lack of domain information on techniques and\ncommercial opportunities, absence of Resource Centers with a regional MAP crop focus and little\nor no access to international markets. Currently marketing of MAPs happens through Mandis &\ncommodity boards, Agricultural produce marketing committees etc. There are numerous\nintermediaries. There are examples from states like Uttarakhand where the State Forest\nDevelopment Corporation have started both fixed and floating mandis which procure MAPs from\nthe doorstep of gatherers thus preventing exploitation and also ensuring remunerative prices.\nThe following steps will be taken up:\nIn order to cater to the domestic market needs of ASU industry, promotion of Primary Producer\nCompanies (PPCs) would be taken-up in a focused manner. These organizations would then be\nbrought into the foreground for marketing of their produce (either cultivated or collected from wild).\n Promotion and information dissemination through IT dedicated mechanisms for\nprocurement of MAPs.\n Networked Agri Mandis for MAPs\n Database of Cultivators\n Contract Extractions (PHM)\n Speciality Warehousing & Supply Chain development\nIntegration of all Portals with techno commercial information\n Creating an on line MAPs Trade Exchange\nIntegration with Krishak Call Centers, KVKs etc.\na) Marketing Intervention\nCurrently marketing of Medicinal plant produce happens through Mandis and other whole sale\nmarkets. Trade is rather opaque and information on prices, arrivals and other trends are not easily\naccessible to farmers/growers. The following steps will be initiated in order to fill this gap.\nDocumenting trade practices.\n Generating information on wholesale prices, arrivals and trends in different markets to\nbenefit both growers and buyers.\n Establishing communication network for speedy collection and dissemination of market\ndata for its efficient and timely utilization.\n Preparing farmer's advisories and issuing the same for the Benefit of farmers towards\noptimizing returns.\n Developing Databases of Cultivators and Cultivars.\nIntegrating and mainstreaming of Medicinal Plants through call centres including Kisan\ncall centres initiatives of Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer’s Welfare.\n Putting in place an appropriate pricing regime in respect of produce sourced from wild v/s\ncultivation in favour of cultivated material so as to encourage cultivation and reduce\npressure on the natural resources.\n Streamlining of HS Codes.\nEligibility\nProposals from reputed agencies having experience in in the field on medicinal plants will be\nconsidered in project mode for commissioning studies.\nSubmission of proposals\nEligible Organizations can apply to NMPB where the proposal will go through scrutiny by the\nProject Screening Committee (PSC) before approval by Standing Finance Committee (SFC).\nb) Minimum Support Price (MSP)\nIn order to supplement the efforts of state governments to encourage sustainable collection of\nmedicinal plants, NMPB would support State agencies engaged in procurement of medicinal plants\nto the extent of 25% of the amount paid by the agency to the collectors.\n Such support from NMPB will be provided to State Governments which have a definite\nmechanism for providing MSP support for medicinal plants.\n The support of MSP for medicinal plants however will not be automatic but would be\nconsidered on a case to case basis in project mode based on the steps taken by State\ngovt. and which are likely to support or result in aiding to help conservation & sustainable\nlivelihoods.\n The mount of MSP support would be released in two instalments subject to the states\ndemonstrating that this measure has a positive impact on conservation & livelihood\ngeneration and the material thus produced is used by industry.\nManagement Support\nOne Project Management Consultant along with one Office Assistant / Data Entry Operator will\nbe engaged for providing support at NMPB level for activities relating to scrutiny, implementation,\nmonitoring and technical support to the state.\nMedicinal Plant Species Specific Campaign including use of Multimedia\nSpecies Specific Campaigns will be launched Nationally or at State level for valuable medicinal\nplants like, Pipli, Chirata, RET species, Amla, Moringa etc. to promote usage and planting\nincluding in institutions, schools, homes, etc.. The campaigns will also identify barriers to wide\nand electronic would also be a part of the campaign and would be organized by both SMPB and\nNMPB. Multimedia campaigns for important medicinal plants and its products through radio, TV\nand print would be taken up to provide information on the importance of medical plants in daily\nlife. For this purpose TV spots would be developed through selected agencies and be telecast\non TV, radio and outdoor hoardings, etc. Besides, talk shows and other programs on radio & TV\nand preparation of documentaries/case studies etc. would be promoted.\nEligibility\n SMPBs and other State Government organizations.\n Recognized academic / Research / Educational institutions\nbasis with activities / experience in the field of medicinal plants.\nNorms of Assistance\nFor Medicinal Plant Species specific campaign, financial assistance will be provided to the eligible\norganisations in project mode.\nSubmission of Proposals\nEligible Organizations can apply to NMPB online where the proposal will go through scrutiny by\nthe Project Screening Committee (PSC) before approval by Standing Finance Committee (SFC).\nInstitutional Strengthening\n8.1. Strengthening of State Medicinal Plant Boards (SMPBs)\n The SMPBs in addition to act coordinating as well as Implementing Agency for various\nactivities supported under NMPB, Ministry of AYUSH’s scheme, are expected to synergise\nvarious interventions by other State agencies related to Medicinal Plants. In order to\nencourage the states to have an independent office of the SMPB it is proposed that an annual\ngrant-in-aid upto Rs.35.00 lakhs per annum can be provided to SMPBs other than SMPBs\nof Union Territories (UTs) and North Eastern States and for SMPBs which are under Union\nTerritories (UTs) and North Eastern States grant-in- aid upto Rs.27.00 lakhs per annum can\nbe provided on annual basis. The assistance/budget will be provided towards remuneration\nof staff (on contractual basis), to meet the expenditure on recurring and non-recurring office\nexpenses, purchase of equipment, office maintenance, mobility support and miscellaneous\nexpenditure including TA/DA/POL, printing/publicity, meeting/conferences, engaging subject\nmatter specialist/ statistical unit etc. In the interest of co-ordination and synergy, NMPB will\nalso direct the States to employ suitable resources/consultants for specific purposes like\npreparing database of traders, cultivators, compilation of yield data, demand and supply of\nmedicinal plants from different sources like Forest Department & cultivators, case studies,\npublication, participation in events related to medicinal plants, exposure visits for stake\nholders etc. NMPB may also promote special studies to evaluate functioning of SMPBs from\ntime to time. An indicative structure and break-up of head-wise staff support to SMPB is\ngiven in Annexure-II. Full time CEO / Member Secretary and separate Budget Head for SMPB\nin the state budget shall be preferred for the Nucleus Centre Grant or else it can be modified by\n SMPBs are required to submit annual action plans in advance indicating the various activities\nand programmes they intend to carry out in the State on year-to-year basis.\nIn addition to Nucleus Centre grant, the grant-in-aid can be considered for SMPBs to meet\nthe obligations of Contractual Farming activities / projects of previous plan period, if any.\n SMPBs are required to work in close coordination with Regional-cum-Facilitation Centres\n(RCFCs) of NMPB and with other State agencies related to Medicinal Plants.\n8.2. Establishing Regional-cum-Facilitation Centres (RCFCs) of NMPB (within existing\nGovernment Institutions, Corporations, Centres of Excellence etc.) in different Geographic\nZones.\nConsidering the topographical spread and valuable traditional knowledge on medicinal plants in\nvarious parts of the country, the success of AYUSH system in the national context actually depends\non region and area specific inputs and active participation of regional units in the implementation\nof the scheme and facilitation thereof. Coordination with states in respect of NMPB schemes for\neach region is currently constrained and harm-strung by the absence of adequate outreach in\nvarious regions of the country. Hence, there is a need to set up the Regional-cum-Facilitation\nCentres (RCFCs). However, no significant infrastructure needs to be created, instead such\nRCFCs will be set up within the existing Government Departments / Institutions (like Institution of\nICAR, CSIR, ICFRE, Universities, AYUSH Institutions etc.) in various eco- regions of the country\nBoards (SMPBs) in a geographic region of the country will also be mentored by these RCFCs. The\nRegional-cum-Facilitation Centres will be actively engaged in the meetings on technical matters of\nthe SMPBs and also assist in the monitoring of projects sanctioned and other assigned work by\nIt is proposed to set up Seven such RCFCs in existing regional institutions and will have the\nfollowing coverage:\nName of Regional-cum-\nFacilitation Centre\nNorthern Region – I\nNorthern Region – II\nStates / UTs\nChandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,\nPunjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh\nJammu & Kashmir, Ladakh\nCentral Region\nEastern Region\nSouthern Region\nNorth Eastern Region\nWestern Region\nChhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh\nBihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, West Bengal\nAndaman & Nicobar, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,\nKerala, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu,\nTelangana\nArunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya,\nMizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura\nDadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Goa, Gujarat,\nMaharashtra, Rajasthan\nSelection of institutions as Regional Cum Facilitation Centre Facilitation Centres (RCFCs)\nResearch and extension organisations or universities in the above mentioned regions will be\nidentified by open advertisement in Newspapers.

Procedure for processing project proposal for approval\n1) All project proposals will be submitted to the NMPB. Once these are received in the Board,\nthey will undergo initial scrutiny and then be placed before the concerned Project Screening\nCommittee (PSC) of the Board. The proposals reviewed & recommended by the PSC will\nbe placed before the Standing Finance Committee (SFC) for final approval.\n2) Other than, in case, when organizations are submitting their proposals through the\nconcerned SMPBs, the SMPBs will have to render their inputs within a period of one month\nof receipt of the proposals. If they do not offer any specific inputs to NMPB within the time\nlimit, it will be presumed that SMPBs agree with the proposals and will provide necessary\nsupport to the implementing agency, if the project is approved by the SFC.\n3) The Board will be free to take expert opinion on project proposals from any\nindividual/agency wherever necessary.\n4) The institutions proposing projects are eligible to levy institutional charges, subject to a\nmaximum of 5% of the total cost of the scheme especially for R & D, Training etc. and other\nsuch projects as approved by SFC.\n5) Once the Board approves a new project, its sanction will be conveyed by the Board to the\nhost institution the sanction letter shall convey expenditure sanction in various broad\nheads viz. staff, equipment, works, recurring contingencies, etc., as finally approved in\neach case.\nImplementation and monitoring\n All project proposal where the duration is one year should generally commence\nimplementation within 3 months of release of first instalment of grant, failing which the\nsanctions accorded can be withdrawn. For other project proposals of duration of more than\none year also normally the implementation has to start within 3 months otherwise the PI\nshould share the justification for delay in implementation of the project.\n The Principal Investigator / Project in-charge (PI) shall submit annual progress report to the\nBoard. The Annual report must contain details about the work done, achievements, results,\n Release of funds can be withheld in the event of non-receipt of utilization certificate and\nprogress reports in time or unsatisfactory progress of work, for ongoing or any previous\nproject approved to the agency.\n On completion of the project, the PI shall submit to the National Medicinal Plants Board a\nfinal report in the prescribed proforma, which shall be examined by the concerned programme\nofficer of the Board, for evaluating the project results, their significance and follow-up\nrequired therein.\n All publications (books, research papers, popular articles) brought out under the project\nsupported by NMPB shall duly acknowledge the support of NMPB.\nGeneral conditions\nThe project proposals may normally be of 3 years duration. However,\nCoordinated/network projects, the project period could be a maximum of 5 years at the\ndiscretion of the SFC. The projects of MPCDAs, In-Situ Resource Augmentation, Ex-Situ\nConservation, Eco-Task Force and creation of Herbal Gardens will also be of five years\nduration. Extension of the project period beyond the approved tenure will be considered\nwith the approval PSC on merit and justification for each proposal.\nScientists, teachers, officers with relevant academic background, appropriately qualified NGO\nwould be eligible to become PI/ Co-PI. In case the PI is working in Govt. Organisation they\nshould have at least 3 years left to superannuate.\nAny incremental scientific, technical and supporting staff will be on contract basis and their\nsalaries, expenditure on equipments, recurring contingencies, TA (PI and Contractual staff)\netc. will be met out of the project grant. The emoluments will be as per the DST pattern for\nResearch and Development or for other as decided by the SFC.\nThe projects implemented through private R&D companies/ organizations should comply with\ngovernment interest.\nAny patent filed will be in the joint ownership of NMPB and the concerned organisation / PI.\nIn case of NGOs, the agency must have an experience of at least 3 years and good track\nrecord in the related field evidenced by the earlier experience and achievements. Also the\nagency must have qualified key resource persons to successfully implement the project. They\nwill also be required to furnish a list of the projects for which they have received funding during\nthe last five years alongwith the sources there of and the tangible outcomes from such works.\nThe NGOs / Companies will also be required to sign a Bond.\nAll NGO's should submit land certificate for ownership of land (in respect of herbal garden)\nand a certificate for genuiness from Registrar of Co-operative Society / Deputy\nCommissioner/other concerned civil authority.\nviii) All projects should spell out a clear exit strategy indicating the proposed mechanism for\nmaintenance of assets created.\nThe PI shall enjoy the freedom in selection of Co-PI and other staff. The appointment will\nnot be regular in nature, but restricted to the project/scheme on contract basis.\nIn case of transfer / leaving of PI, Co-PI will hold the charge of the project and will perform\nthe duties of PI. In case there is no Co-PI, the host institute will suggest the name of\nsuitable PI to handle the project. In case of transfer of the PI and the earlier organisation\nnot having appropriate resource person to handle the project the project could be shifted to\nthe institution on the request of the PI concerned. Such decisions will be taken by CEO,\nNMPB on case to case basis and brought to notice of PSC for information.\nFor important projects under implementation which may require technical input from the PSC\nthe PI may be called for presentation from time to time by PSC so that best value could be\nobtained from such ongoing works.\nxii) Under non-recurring head, financial assistance could be provided for only selected, essential\nand specialized items of equipments required for project works, for modification of existing\nstructure so for undertaking petty works.\nxiii) The implementing institution, without approval of the CEO, NMPB, shall not re-appropriate\nfunds among different heads of expenditures of a scheme, except in case of recurring\ncontingencies.\nxiv) Component towards rental value of land/lease rent shall not exceed 10% of project cost.\nxv) Expenses towards manpower for supervision, and other technical input shall be as per\nrequirement.\nthe guidelines or in the letter of sanction.\nIt will invariably be the sole duty of the PI and his organization to abide by all laws while\nimplementing the project.\nxviii) Cost norms for activities in high alpine regions and trans Himalayan regions could be upto 1\n½ times of otherwise prescribed norms. This could be decided by the SFC on a case to case\nbasis.\nxix) For any other components in the Scheme for which specific costs, norms have not been given,\nthese will be considered by SFC in project mode.\nxx) Within approved project period, grants, released in a year will be deemed to be carried forward\nto the next year if not fully utilized in the initial year.\nIn a need based approach to enable response to changing situations SFC may decide to\nincorporate additional activities within the overall outlay of the Scheme.\nalso be reviewed / fine-tuned from time to time by the PSC and shall be dully intimated to the\nxxiii) Periodic progress reports received from the PI will be reviewed by the concerned\nprogramme officer in the NMPB so as to decide the progress is satisfactory or\nthere are any shortfall or any course correction is needed for which feedback has\nto be given to the implementing organization.\nxxiv) An annual increase of 10% of the outlay of the sanctioned amount will be provided\nfor conservation & Resource augmentation projects.\n12. Monitoring and Evaluation\nMonitoring and Evaluation by the State Medicinal Plants Boards.\nThe State Medicinal Plant Boards (where they are themselves not the implementing agency) can be\ninvolved in monitoring the projects at the field level through their own set of experts for mentoring\nand suggesting corrective measures. The SMPBs can approach NMPB for offering their\nwillingness for undertaking this assignment. Therefore, field mentoring and monitoring of all\nprojects can be undertaken by SMPB's / other organizations and for this purpose, the services of\nretired officers of Forests / Horticulture / Agriculture departments, scientists etc. may be hired within\nthis grant approved for SMPB / other organizations.\nThird Party Monitoring\nThird party monitoring is important for the success of any scheme being implemented at the national\nlevel. There could be two types of arrangements - either through the system of experts or hiring\nan agency. One or more National Level Agencies with adequate manpower and infrastructure will\nbe engaged by NMPB to monitor the projects as per requirement. In addition, NMPB may also\nconstitute short term mentoring-cum-monitoring teams from time to time for specific projects, as\nfelt necessary.\nIII. Chief Technical Advisers / Domain Expert for Mentoring\nNMPB will draw up a list of experts and nominate theme wise / species wise experts as Chief Technical\nAdvisers (CTAs) on important themes related to medicinal plants. The CTAs will be asked from time\nto time to visit States / Project implementation locations to provide hand-holding support on their\narea of expertise to the states / implementing agencies and for providing such services, CTAs will\nbe reimbursed AC II tier / Economy Class Air fare and local travelling expenses, Boarding / lodging\ncharges etc. and will also be eligible for sitting fee as per rule. However, such hand holding\nassignments (excluding travel time from their HQ) will be of short duration (3 days or less) after which\nCTAs will submit the reports to NMPB, for each such assignment.\nNMPB can also engage Domain Expert as per requirement for implementation and monitoring of\nthe projects / activities.\nNote: The proforma for submission of the proposals and utilization certificates, progress\nS.

Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Naturopathy, except Allopathy. More than 70% of India’s 1.1 billion population still use these non-allopathic systems of medicine. Currently, there is no separate category of herbal drugs or dietary supplements, as per the Indian Drugs Act. However, there is a vast experiential-evidence base for many of the natural drugs. This offers immense opportunities for Observational Therapeutics and Reverse Pharmacology. Evidence-based herbals are widely used in the diverse systems and manufactured, as per the pharmacopoeial guidelines, by a well-organised industry. Significant basic and clinical research has been carried out on the medicinal plants and their formulations, with the state-of-the-art methods in a number of Institutes/Universities. There are some good examples. Indian medicinal plants also provide a rich source for antioxidants that are known to prevent/delay different diseased states. The antioxidant protection is observed at different levels. The medicinal plants also contain other beneficial compounds like ingredients for functional foods. Hence, the global knowledge about Ayurveda and Indian herbals will hopefully be enhanced by information on the evidence-base of these plants. This will yield rich dividends in the coming years.\nKeywords:\nAyurveda, Indian medicinal plants, reverse pharmacology, observational therapeutics, antioxidant\nIntroduction\nIndia has a very long, safe and continuous usage of many herbal drugs in the officially recognized alternative systems of health\n. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Naturopathy. These systems have rightfully existed side-by-side with Allopathy and are not in ‘the domain of obscurity’, as stated by Venkat Subramanian [\n]. Millions of Indians use herbal drugs regularly, as spices, home-remedies, health foods as well as over-the-counter (OTC) as self-medication or also as drugs prescribed in the non-allopathic systems [\nThe developer of a potent natural product penicillin, Nobel-laureate Ernst Boris Chain wrote an inspiring article entitled “The quest for new biodynamic substances”. In 1967, he wrote, “In China and India there has been an extensive drive aimed at the systemic study of medicinal plants traditionally used in these countries in folklore medicine; this has failed, so far, to bring to light new classes of compounds with interesting pharmacologic activities. As far as drug research is concerned, therefore, we cannot expect many major surprises to come from the study of plant constituents” [\n]. The current overview would disprove the infallibility of this Nobel laureate, by giving examples of novel activities of Indian medicinal plants.\nObservational Therapeutics and Reverse Pharmacology\nIndia, having a pluralistic healthcare system, offers an unfettered choice for the quest for new clinical effects of traditionally used medicinal plants [\n]. Roy Chaudhary coined a neologism for such a discipline—Observational Therapeutics [\n]. He expressed his hope that further research directed at a few of the chronic diseases against which more drugs are needed, such as diabetes, bronchial asthma, could lead to the discovery of new drugs for these conditions. Observational Therapeutics is an antecedent of the path of Reverse Pharmacology for new natural drug development. Reverse Pharmacology was proposed and initiated by Vaidya [\n]. Reverse Pharmacology is possible only in those countries with pluralistic healthcare and where robust clinical and laboratory documentation of novel human, pharmacodynamic effects are possible by inter-system collaborative teamwork [\n]. India, at the national level, has adopted this approach of Reverse Pharmacology and also the golden triangular research for correlating the three fields by R & D network\nmodern medicine, Indian systems of medicine, and life and pharmaceutical sciences [\n]. Reverse Pharmacology is defined as the science of integrating documented clinical/experiential hits, into leads by transdisciplinary exploratory studies and further developing these into drug candidates by experimental and clinical research. The identification of structures with novel biodynamic effects can also lead to new chemical entity path for drug development.\nThe scope of Reverse Pharmacology is to understand the mechanisms of action at multiple levels of biological organization and to optimise safety, efficacy and acceptability of the leads in natural products, based on relevant science.\nResearch Approach to Herbal Products\nThe path of Reverse Pharmacology, arising from Observational Therapeutics is complementary to other approaches for natural drug development (Fig.\nFig. 1.\nOpen in a new tab\nResearch Approach to herbal products (R & D Path for Natural Products)\nThe diversity of medical uses of plant is at times daunting for a new entrant to the field. But for a multidisciplinary research and a development network the options of research approach provide deep motivation for identification of new pharmacophores. Besides expanding the herbal therapeutic and preventive armamentarium, new pharmacophores may help to evolve new targets of drug action as well as a possibility for combinatorial chemistry on the novel pharmacophores. For example, curcumin has been a target molecule for a significant endeavour for a large number of combinatorial compounds. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), in India has initiated sizeable and meaningful efforts for the development of herbal-based formulations for diabetes, arthritis and hepatitis by a national network programme [\n]. The industry, the academia and the government research laboratories work in close collaboration. Interesting and novel activities have been detected with the selected plants and some of the active ingredients of therapeutically demonstrable effects e.g. glycaemic control and inhibition of HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) level coupled with a reduction in\nin vitro\nformation of Amadori products.\nThe diverse approaches to herbal drugs have led to interesting hits and novel activities, which need further in depth drug development efforts, both as herbal as well as new single molecule drugs.

There are many references to Indian medicinal plants and trade in spices in a number of historical documents. For instance, Indian aloe is very widely used in India for cosmetic, medicinal and nutraceutical purposes [\n]. But the antiaging effects of the pickled preparations are unique [\n]. Despite the global reputation of aloe in dermato-cosmetics, the potential as antiaging is still untapped. Similarly, the plant\nAdhatoda vasica\nhas been extensively studied for cough and the active principles have been known [\n]. However, the potential for use in bleeding disorders and tuberculosis is untapped. Table\ncites the clinical uses and the therapeutic potential of 14 selected Indian medicinal plants [\n]. There is a need for an international collaborative effort to explore, on a fast track, the hits provided by clinical observations of astute physicians.\nTable 4.\nUse and potential of selected Indian plants\nPlant name\nCommonest Ayurvedic usage\nReferences\nTherapeutic potential\nReferences\nAdhatoda vasica\nKasashwasaghna (Antitussive)\nAntituberculosis, Haemostatic\nAloe vera\nKushtghna (Skin diseases), Agnidagdha vrana (Burns)\nAntidiabetic\nBoswellia serrata\nShothaghna (Anti inflammatory), Grahaghna (Anti spasmodic)\nImmunomodulator\nCentella asiatica\nSmritiprada (Memory-enhancing), Kushtaghna (Skin diseases)\nAntiaging\nCurcuma longa\nPramehaghna (Anti-diabetic), Kandooghna (Anti pruritic), Vranapaha (Wound healing)\nCancer Prevention\nLeptadenia reticulata\nStanya (Galactogogue)\nAnticonjunctivitis\nMucuna pruriens\nVrushya (Aphrodisiac)\nAntiparkinsonism\nOcimum sanctum\nPratishyayahara (Anti cold)\nAnticancer\nPicrorrhiza kurroa\nKamalahara (Anti-jaundice)\nLipid-lowering\nPiper longum\nShwasakasahara (Anti asthamatic)\nAntimalarial\nPterocarpus marsupium\nMehaghna (Anti-diabetic)\nAntiinflammatory\nTerminalia chebula\nAnulomana (Mild laxative)\nMedhya\nTribulus terrestris\nAshmarighna (Litholytic)\nAntiprostatism\nTrigonella foenum-graecum\nMedoghna (Lipid lowering), Stanya (Galactogogue)\nAntidiadetic\nOpen in a new tab\nReverse Pharmacology on these selected plants may lead not only to new leads and drug candidates but also to novel targets and pharmacodynamic efforts. For example, investigations on\nColeus forskohlii\n, used as pickles in some parts of India, led to isolation of forskolin, with multifaceted effects. The latter were mediated by activation of adenylate cylase and increased concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [\n]. Subsequently, forskolin (Fig.\n) has served as a very important tool in molecular pharmacology and endocrinology.\nFig. 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nForskolin (7β-acetoxy-8, 13-epoxy-1, 6β, 9-trihydroxylabd-14-en-11-one)\nThere are cAMP-independent effects of forskolin\nthrough modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel desensitization, modulation of voltage-gated potassium channels, reversal of multidrug resistance etc. [\n]. This example suggests the complexity of effects of even simple phytomolecules. Hence, the emphasis has to be primarily on the human effect, as documented in Observational Therapeutics.\nIndian Medicinal Plants as a Source of Antioxidants and Radical Scavengers\nIn recent years, there is a tremendous interest in the possible role of nutrition in prevention of disease. In this context, antioxidants, especially derived from natural sources such as Indian medicinal plants and herbal drugs derived from them, require special attention. Antioxidants neutralize the toxic and ‘volatile’ free radicals. Antioxidants have many potential applications, especially in relation to human health, both in terms of prevention of disease and therapy [\n]. In biological systems oxygen gives rise to a large number of free radicals and other reactive species collectively known as ‘reactive oxygen species’ (ROS). Another group of reactive species are termed as ‘reactive nitrogen species’ (RNS) [\n]. In a normal healthy human, the generation of ROS and RNS are effectively kept in check by the various levels of antioxidant defense. However, when the humans get exposed to adverse physiochemical, environmental or pathological agents this delicately maintained balance is shifted in favour of pro-oxidants resulting in oxidative stress [\n]. Cellular damage induced by oxidative stress has been implicated in the etiology of a large number (>100) of human diseases as well as the process of ageing. Various antioxidants may prevent and/or improve diseased states [\n]. These include the intracellular antioxidant enzymes and the dietary or oral supplements in the form of vitamin C, vitamin E, β-carotene, zinc and selenium [\n]. Antioxidants also can act at different levels of protection such as prevention, interception and repair.\nIndian medicinal plants provide a rich source of antioxidants. A review of literature shows that there are over 40 Indian medicinal plants showing antioxidant abilities at various levels of protection (Table\n). The medicinal plants that show significant antioxidant activity include\nAcacia catechu\nAchyranthes aspera\nAegle marmelos\n(Bengal quince, Bel),\nAglaia roxburghiana\n(Priyangu),\nAllium cepa\n(Onion),\nAllium sativum\nAloe vera\nAmomum subulatum\nAndrographis paniculata\nAsparagus racemosus\nAzadirachta indica\nBacopa monniera\nBauhinia purpurea\nBrassica campastris\nButea monosperma\nCamellia sinensis\nCapparis decidua\nCapsicum annum\nCentella asiatica\nCinnamomum verum\nCommiphora mukul\nCrataeva nurvala\nCrocus sativus\nCurcuma longa\nCymbopogan citrates\nEmblica officinalis\nEmilia sonchifolia\nGarcinia atroviridis\nGarcinia kola\nGlycyrrhiza glabra\nHemidesmus indicus\nHypericum perforatum\nIndigofera tinctoria\nMelissa officinalis\nMomordica charantia\nMorus alba\nMurraya koenigii\nNigella sativa\nOcimum sanctum\nPicrorrhiza kurroa\nPiper beetle\nPlumbago zeylanica\nPremna tomentosa\nPunica granatum\nRubia cordifolia\nSesamum indicum\nSida cordifolia\nSwertia decursata\nSyzigium cumini\nTerminalia arjuna\nTerminalia bellarica\nTinospora cordifolia\nTrigonella foenum-graecum\nWithania somnifera\nZingiber officinalis\n]. There are also a number of ayurvedic formulations containing ingredients from medicinal plants that show antioxidant activities. These are Abana, Amrita bindu, C-phycocyanin, Centalaplus, Chapparal, Geriforte, Jigrine, Liv-52, Maharishi formulations, Muthu marunthu, Ophtacare, P55A, Sandhika, Student rasayana and Tamra bhasma. There are still a large number of plants and ayurvedic formulations whose antioxidant activities need to be examined in relation to their potential therapeutic and related beneficial properties. More recent assays also should be included to study the antioxidant properties of medicinal plants or their chemical constituents. This will greatly help in identifying more potent compounds with potential applications in prevention and/or therapy of human ailments. Newer approaches utilizing collaborative research and modern technology in combination with established traditional health principles will yield rich dividends in the near future in improving health, especially among people who do not have access to the use of costlier western systems of medicine.\nTable 5.\nIndian medicinal plants and levels of antioxidant action\nLevel 1: Suppression of radical formation\nCassia occidentalis, Crocus sativus, Emblica officinalis, Hemidesmus indicus, Indigofera tinctoria, Momordica charantia, Murraya koenigii, Ocimum sanctum, Picrorhiza kurroa, Sida cordifolia, Spirulina fusiformis, Tinospora cordifolia, Vinca rosea, Withania somnifera & Zingiber officinale\nLevel 2: Scavenging of primary radicals\nAcacia catechu, Aloe vera, Butea monosperma, Crocus sativus, Curcuma longa, Hippophae rhamnoides, Indigofera tinctoria, Momordica charantia, Ocimum sanctum, Plumbago zeylanica, Psoralea corylifolia, Rotula aquatica & Swertia decussata\nLevel 3: Scavenging of secondary radicals\nAllium sativum, Allium cepa, Aloe vera, Amaranthus blitum, Argemon maxicana, Asparagus racemosus, Azadirachta indica, Curcuma longa, Emblica officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hemidesmus indicus, Mangifera indica, Momordica charantia, Murraya koenigii, Ocimum sanctum, Onosoma echioides, Picrorhiza kurroa, Piper betel, Plumbago zeylanica, Psoralea corylifolia, Sesamum indicum, Sida cordifolia, Swertia decussata, Terminalia bellarica, Tinospora cordifolia, Vinca rosea, Withania somnifera & Zingiber officinale\nLevel 4: Reconstitution of membranes\nAllium sativum, Aloe vera, Camellia sinensis, Curcuma longa, Argemon maxicana, Cassia occidentalis, Crocus sativus, Emblica officinalis, Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Vinca rosea, Withania somnifera & Zingiber officinale\nLevel 5: Repair of damage\nOcimum sanctum &, Hibiscus sabdariffa\nOpen in a new tab\nIndian Medicinal Plants as a Source of Other Beneficial Compounds\nThese medicinal plants are also important source of other type of beneficial compounds including the ingredients for functional foods. These functional foods promote better health to prevent chronic illness. Some ingredients that make food functional are dietary fibres, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, oligosaccharides, essential fatty acids (omega-3), lactic acid bacteria cultures and lignins. Many of these are present in medicinal plants. Indian systems of medicine believe that complex diseases can be treated with complex combination of botanicals unlike in the West, with single drugs. Whole foods are hence used in India as functional foods rather than supplements. Some medicinal plants and dietary constituents having functional attributes are spices such as onion, garlic, mustard, red chilli, turmeric, clove, cinnamon, saffron, curry leaf, fenugreek and ginger. Some herbs such as\nBixa orellana\nand vegetables like amla, wheat grass, soybean and\nGarcinia cambogia\nhave antitumor effects [\n]. Other medicinal plants with such functional properties include\nAegle marmelos\nAllium cepa\nAloe vera\nAndrographis paniculata\nAzadirachta indica\nBrassica juncea\nConclusion and Future Prospects\nIn India more than 70% of the population use herbal drugs for their health. There is a vast experience-based evidence for many of these drugs. There are also a number of Institutes/Universities in India carrying our research on herbal drugs and medicinal plants. Using ‘reverse pharmacological’ approach, several Institutes carry out basic and clinical research on the potential health benefits of herbal drugs. There are many successful examples in this direction. These herbal drugs and Indian medicinal plants are also rich sources of beneficial compounds including antioxidants and components that can be used in functional foods. Newer approaches utilizing collaborative research and modern technology in combination with established traditional health principles will yield rich dividends in the near future in improving health, especially among people who do not have access to the use of costlier western systems of medicine.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Shridhar Anishetty and Mr. Rajkumar Mishra for their help in preparation of the overview.\nReferences\nVenkat Subramanian T.C.

    "content": "Ayurvedic Medicine: In Depth\nIs Ayurvedic Medicine Safe?\nSome Ayurvedic preparations may contain lead, mercury, or arsenic in amounts that can be toxic.\nIs Ayurvedic Medicine Effective?\nA few studies suggest that Ayurvedic preparations may reduce pain and increase function in people with osteoarthritis and help manage symptoms in people with type 2 diabetes, but most of these trials are small or not well-designed. There is little scientific evidence on\nAyurveda\nâs value for other health issues.\nHow much do we know about Ayurvedic medicine?\nAlthough\nAyurvedic medicine\nand its components have been described in many scholarly articles, only a small number of clinical trials using these approaches have been published in Western medical journals. About 240,000 American adults use Ayurvedic medicine.\nWhat Is Ayurvedic Medicine?\nThe ancient Indian medical system, also known as Ayurveda, is based on ancient writings that rely on a ânaturalâ and holistic approach to physical and mental health. Ayurvedic medicine is one of the worldâs oldest medical systems and remains one of Indiaâs traditional health care systems. Ayurvedic treatment combines products (mainly derived from plants, but may also include animal, metal, and mineral), diet, exercise, and lifestyle.\nWhat the Science Says About the Effectiveness of Ayurvedic Medicine\nFew well-designed clinical trials and systematic research reviews suggest that Ayurvedic approaches are effective.\nResults from a 2013\nclinical trial\ncompared two Ayurvedic formulations of plant extracts against the\nnatural product\nglucosamine\nsulfate and the drug celecoxib in 440 people with knee osteoarthritis. All four products provided similar reductions in pain and improvements in function.\nA preliminary and small NCCIH-funded 2011 pilot study with 43 people found that conventional and Ayurvedic treatments for rheumatoid arthritis were similarly effective. The conventional drug tested was methotrexate and the Ayurvedic treatment included 40 herbal compounds.\nOutcomes from a small short-term clinical trial with 89 men and women suggested that a formulation of five Ayurvedic herbs may help people with type 2 diabetes. However, other researchers said inadequate study designs havenât allowed researchers to develop firm conclusions about Ayurveda for diabetes.\nTurmeric, an\noften used in Ayurvedic preparations, may help with ulcerative colitis, but the two studies reporting this were smallâone, published in 2005, included 10 people while the other, published in 2006, had 89.\nWhat the Science Says About the Safety of Ayurvedic Medicine\nSome Ayurvedic preparations include metals, minerals, or gems. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that the presence of metals in some Ayurvedic products makes them potentially harmful.\nA 2015 published survey of people who use Ayurvedic preparations showed that 40 percent had elevated blood levels of lead and some had elevated blood levels of mercury. About one in four of the supplements tested had high levels of lead and almost half of them had high levels of mercury.\nA 2015 case report published in the Center for Disease Controlâs\nMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\nlinked elevated blood lead levels in a 64-year-old woman with Ayurvedic preparations purchased on the Internet.\nAlthough rare, Ayurvedic products may cause arsenic poisoning.\nNCCIH-Funded Research\nNCCIH is funding research that:\nBuilds on earlier investigations in breast cancer survivors that found a positive effect of integrated Ayurvedic medicine on improved quality of life; new research will evaluate ways to make this intervention easier to incorporate into peoplesâ lives. The proposed Ayurvedic intervention includes diet, lifestyle,\n, and pressure point treatment.\nStudies the mechanism by which an extract from\nButea monosperma\n(BME) flowers may protect against joint destruction from osteoarthritis (BME is widely used in Ayurveda for arthritis and other inflammatory diseases in India).\nMore To Consider\nDonât use Ayurvedic medicine to postpone seeing a conventional health care provider about a medical problem.\nIf you have a health condition, talk with your conventional health care provider before using Ayurvedic products.\nThere is no significant regulation of Ayurvedic practice or education in the United States, and no state requires a practitioner to have a license. For more information on credentialing complementary health practitioners, see the NCCIH fact sheet\nCredentialing, Licensing, and Education\nIf youâre pregnant or nursing, be sure to consult your (or your childâs) health care provider as some Ayurvedic products may contain products that could be harmful.\nTell all your health care providers about any complementary or integrative health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care.\nFor More Information\nNCCIH Clearinghouse\nThe NCCIH Clearinghouse provides information onÂ NCCIHÂ and complementary and integrative health approaches, including publications and searches of Federal databases of scientific and medical literature.

This system was reinforced in\nthe Trans-Himalayan region and is popular in the Himalayan\nsocieties such as Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh (Spiti and Lahoul),\nJammu and Kashmir, West Bengal (Darjeeling), Arunachal Pradesh,\nand Sikkim.\nSowa-Rigpa has been recognized and\npromoted by the Government of India as a traditional medical\nsystem. Just like the spread of Buddhism, the Sowa- Rigpa has\nalso established its influence in various parts of the world.\nAlso known as the Amchi System of medicine, it is practiced in\nsome parts of China, the Himalayan regions of India, Mongolia,\nNepal, Russia, and Bhutan. Sowa- Rigpa is perceived to be similar\nto Ayurvedic Philosophy. More than 75 percent of the Sowa-Rigpa\ntests have been derived from the Ashtanga Hridaya; a famous\nexposition of Ayurveda. Many medicines of the Indian-origin such\nas Ashwagandha, Guggulu, Triphala, Ashok, Haridra, etc. are used\nin the Sowa-Rigpa system for treatment purposes.\nIndia had been a learning hotspot for\nBuddhist art and culture and attracted a lot of Tibetan Students.\nAlso, many Indian scholars were invited to prorogate Buddhism and\nother art and sciences of India. This association resulted in the\ntranslation and preservation of Indian Literature on art,\nculture, language, science, and religion in the Tibetan language.\nThese texts were further enhanced in Tibet and are now preserved\nin Tibetan Literatures, both in Canonical and Non-Canonical\nforms. Sowa-Rigpa or the Science of Healing is an example of the\nsame. Gyud-Zi or four tantra was the fundamental textbook of this\nform of medicine that was translated from India and was then\nenriched in the region of Tibet. The principles of Sowa-Rigpa,\nits do’s and don’ts, pulse examination, and dietary guidelines\nare some factors that indicate its proximity within India.\nAbout Section end\nlayout section end\nfooter section start\nSignup (Student & institute) start\nSignup (Student & institute) end\nback to top section start\nback to top section end\nfooter section end\nOther JS Files\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/watermark/common.js\"></script> 04_02_2023\ncustom bg animation start\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"admin/assets/vendor/custom-bg-animation/script.js\"></script>\ncustom bg animation end"

    "content": "Survey, Collection & Cultivation of Medicinal Plants\nAbout 70% of the Homeopathic drugs are derived from medicinal plants sources and for maintaining the quality of the drug, the source material is collected either from wild occurrence or is cultivated in the gardens with expert supervision. For maintaining authentic plant source material in fresh and live condition, the Council has established a medicinal plants research garden and a Survey of Medicinal Plants and Cultivation Unit, which collects raw drug plant material from areas surveyed from all over India. This research unit has now been renamed as “Centre of Medicinal Plants Research in Homoeopathy” in Tamil Nadu at Indira Nagar, Emerald Post, Nilgiris District (T. N.), taking into account the manifold aspects of research work on medicinal plants being carried out here. This research centre in addition to conducting survey for the collection of the medicinal plants used in Homoeopathy in its wild state also cultivates both exotic and indigenous plant material for supply as and when required for drug standardization or drug preparation, both for in-house research and also for Homoeopathic drug manufacturers the surplus raw drug plant material in ‘not for profit’ basis.\nCurrently 104 plant (92 exotic plants and 12 indigenous plant species are being cultivated the plant species are under experimental cultivation and below conservation cum germplasm collection at demonstration plots for further multiplication or seed production to continue as next generation and being maintained as reference species useful in Homoeopathy\n. In addition the laboratory for carrying out drug standardization research studies is also hoped to be established here in future, bringing all aspects of research in medicinal plants under one umbrella.\nThe Centre has conducted 372 surveys and supplied 702 raw drugs to Units for carrying out standardisation studies, 11717 herbarium sheets have been prepared and mounted with their voucher specimen number till date.\nA rigid poly house constructed by poly carbonate sheet has been inaugurated by Director general, CCRH during the visit of Special Committee Members of Drug Standardization in the month of August 2017, the utilization of this poly house and its usage is mainly for the process of seedling germination, vegetative propagation (VP-Clones),and mass production of plantlet for development/cultivation of the entire larger area for internal usage, for the supply of raw drug to drug standardization units and for commercial purpose. This poly house is very unique and constructed for the first time in Nilgiris by using poly carbonate sheet.\nSale of Homoeopathic Medicinal Plants raw drug\n( as on 11.01.2018)\n(At CMPRH Research Garden, Emerald, Tamil Nadu)\nSl.
